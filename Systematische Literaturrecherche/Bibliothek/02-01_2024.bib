	abstract = {This study investigates the efficacy of the web-based Cooperative Integrated Reading Composition (CIRC) technique in developing English as a Foreign Language (EFL) reading comprehension skills among first-year prep Experimental Language School learners. The research aims to address the low performance of students in EFL reading comprehension skills (creative, critical, and literal comprehension). The study utilized a pre-post one-group design, collecting data from thirty Egyptian female learners with an average age of 12.5 years. The research instruments included a pre-integrated reading test, a post-integrated reading test, and a scoring rubric. The researchers analyzed the data using a paired sample t-test after the eight-week CIRC intervention. Results indicate that the web-based CIRC technique significantly improves overall reading comprehension skills, including creative, critical, and literal comprehension. The outcomes of the study emphasize that web-based CIRC is useful in language education, particularly in improving reading comprehension skills. The study emphasizes the importance of incorporating authentic materials and employing cooperative learning strategies to enhance reading comprehension skills. The findings provide valuable information for decision-making and offer practical implications for EFL reading comprehension.},

	abstract = {This study explored patterns of social interaction and group-level regulation in terms of co- and socially shared regulation in collaborative learning and their relation to learners’ metacognitive task perceptions. 72 secondary school students performed collaborative physics tasks in small groups over multiple 90-minute sessions. Video recordings (∼148.5 h) of collaborative interactions and pre- and post- situated selfreports of learners’ task perceptions were collected. The collaborative sessions were clustered and collaborative interaction patterns were examined. Finally, learners’ task perceptions in the clusters were investigated. The results showed different collaborative interaction patterns and differences in learners’ task perceptions between the clusters. The main finding is that continuous active participation in socioemotional interactions alongside cognitive-focused interactions and appropriate group-level regulation of learning positively influence learners’ perceived task understanding. These findings add to current understanding of collaborative interactions as temporal processes and contribute to practical implications for supporting collaborative interactions to enhance metacognitive skills.},

	abstract = {Online one-on-one tutoring serves as a personalized approach to supplement classroom instruction. However, with the growing tutoring market, a single tutor often handles inquiries from students across primary, middle, and high school levels. Consequently, the extent of tutors’ interactions with students of varying grades and their use of tutoring strategies to enhance student learning remains unclear. To address this gap, we collected and analyzed 1500 tutoring dialogues from amateur mathematics tutors concurrently instructing students from primary, middle, and high school levels. These dialogues were annotated using a coding scheme and a well-trained powerful artificial intelligence (AI) model. The interaction dynamics were subsequently examined using epistemic network analysis and lag sequential analysis, yielding findings on the occurrences, co-occurrences, and sequential patterns of dialogic strategies. First, the results reveal that tutors frequently engaged in off-topic behaviors and direct instruction, regardless of students’ educational level. Second, tutors’ constructive questions and knowledge sharing and instruction were more associated with greater constructive expressions from students at higher educational levels, while primary students primarily demonstrated simple acknowledgment. Third, tutors exhibited limited sequential patterns of dialogic strategies when tutoring primary and middle school students, mainly focusing on questionasking behaviors and evaluation and feedback. In contrast, tutors displayed diverse patterns across various categories of dialogic strategies when instructing high school students, emphasizing the facilitation of students’ reasoning and metacognition. These findings underscore the importance of training tutors to develop dialogic skills and adopt tailored pedagogical approaches for different educational levels, ensuring effective and efficient online one-on-one mathematics tutoring.},

To examine the potential of robots through extended embodied cognition, this quasi-experimental study was conducted in the English for Medical Purposes classrooms at the Isfahan University of Medical Sciences. In the 2022 academic year, 526 male and female participants, whose ﬁrst language is not English, were selected. Students were sorted into three English proﬁciency levels: pre-intermediate (n ¼ 176), intermediate (n ¼ 175), and upper-intermediate (n ¼ 175), then semirandomly divided into three-member teams, subsequently, randomly assigned to control (n ¼ 370) or experimental (n ¼ 156) groups. Students in the control group learned English for Medical Purposes listening and reading through online classrooms, while those in the experimental group learned the skills in robot (augmented reality)-assisted classrooms. In the control and experimental groups, ﬂipped classrooms were conducted under the supervision of the teachers. The primary data sources included formative assessments of the participants’ English for Medical Purposes listening and reading, as well as interviews. The ﬁndings showed that the participants in the robot’s augmented reality group achieved signiﬁcantly higher results, when compared with robot-only and control groups, in English for Medical Purposes listening and reading in academia and the healthcare ﬁelds. The positive perception participants had of robot’s augmented reality was clear, based on interview results. The outcomes are discussed in detail.},

It pre­ sents an ongoing action research project in collaboration with a high school in Western Australia, involving four teachers to inte­ grate GenAI in their classrooms. The study aims to develop and evaluate innovative pedagogies for leveraging GenAI to enhance educational practices and student learning outcomes across three action research teams focusing on critical questioning, assessment and differentiation. Drawing on Bakhtin’s concept of heteroglossia, the study conceptualizes GenAI not as a definitive knowledge provider but as a dialogic agent that facilitates collaborative dialo­ gue and co-construction of knowledge among students. This per­ spective aims to encourage students to critically engage with AIgenerated content and integrate multiple viewpoints into their learning, thus fostering key epistemic skills. Initial findings demon­ strate active student engagement in dialogues with GenAI, high­ lighting the use of follow-up questions that indicate critical thinking and creativity. These findings underscore the significance of inte­ grating multiple perspectives and fostering epistemic skills among students, promoting a comprehensive and ethical approach to AI use in education. The research calls for further exploration of GenAI’s pedagogic potential and its broader implications for edu­ cational practices, suggesting a promising avenue for pedagogical innovation and the development of critical thinking skills in the digital age.},

In addition, we introduce dynamic model conﬁdence to guide the independent and mutual learning of these models, encouraging the models to learn more reliable information from unlabeled data.

The aim of this study was to develop a model in order to analyse the key factors affecting purposeful online collaborative learning. The participants in the study were 799 students in higher education who had experienced this type of methodology. A questionnaire was created, organized into 7 constructs. This was used to produce a research model with reflective variables using the Partial Least Squares (PLS) technique, which demonstrated good predictive ability (R2=0.712). The 10 hypotheses underpinning the model were confirmed. The results indicate that variables such as satisfaction, perceptions of use and enjoyment, and group dynamics had a significant, positive influence on students’ perceptions of online collaborative learning. Mediating variables of interest were also identified, such as intra-group emotional support (R2=0.595)—with its link to perceived enjoyment—and the importance of online tools and group dynamics as fundamental elements for developing proper emotional support within the framework of CSCL processes. Finally, the results are discussed, along with their impact on improving teaching in higher education when implementing CSCL.},

	abstract = {Virtual learning environments are technological systems designed to use electronic media to enable nonface-to-face education and interaction between students to take place. The research presented here considered six academic years and was carried out against the backdrop of the impact that these environments are having on higher education. It used a non-experimental, retrospective, cross-sectional approach, and was conducted within the qualitative phenomenological paradigm. The participants were 211 students who were engaged in an online postgraduate course. The aim was to identify the benefits and difficulties the students encountered when they used collaborative tools in their learning process, and the group dynamics that were established. Portfolios, forums and focus groups were the mechanisms used for data collection. The results showed a great diversity in how digital tools were used, how they were adapted to the complexity of the virtual classroom and the multi-professional profile of the participants. However, in general, the participants displayed a strong need for connection in order to share their concerns, develop bonds and build collective knowledge. There was greater emphasis on collaborative tasks during and after the pandemic than in previous periods. It was concluded that the integration of online collaboration tools among postgraduate students to carry out academic activities reflected the key role that virtual environments play in the shaping of meaningful interdisciplinary and socialisation educational experiences. In addition, the role of the group's own self-regulation in terms of maturity, networking, chronological adjustments and understanding of the task at hand was essential in the participants’ ability to overcome the challenges they encountered.},

Data was collected following a mixed-method approach. A cross-case analysis, including a correlation analysis of teachers’ motivations and their perception about different incentive mechanisms, suggests that there is a relationship between these factors. Teachers’ main motivation is to gain knowledge, and they perceive recommendation systems, tutorials, news sections and social features as the most interesting features to be implemented in an OC of teachers. In contrast, they consider reputation as the least important motivator, and they do not perceive features such as users’ rankings or contributors’ acknowledgement sections as important. These results contribute to the improvement of the supporting platforms for OC of teachers and the integration in teaching practice.},

In collaborative learning environments, empathy assumes even greater signiﬁcance as it facilitates idea exchange and problem-solving among students. While previous studies have explored the role of empathy in collaboration, research focusing speciﬁcally on its impact on Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) remains limited. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the relationship between students’ levels of affective and cognitive empathy and their chat discussion behavior within a CSCL environment. An exploratory descriptive study with 188 students from Spain (N = 133) and Brazil (N = 55) (Mage = 15.7 years) examined how affective and cognitive empathy inﬂuence student’s online discussion within a CSCL environment. This study provides initial insights into the relationship between empathy and online collaboration. The ﬁndings indicate a positive correlation between students’ levels of Perspective Taking and messages oriented to socialization. While, groups with higher max values under cognitive and affective empathy demonstrated a positive correlation with task-oriented messages. This study provides novel insights into the emergence of empathy within CSCL environments and has implications for the design of online collaborative learning platforms and educational technologies.},

The ﬁndings revealed that the GenAI chatbot provides useful feedback as students rate the chatbot’s answers higher than their peers’ answers (MChatbot = 4.11, MStudents = 3.91). The presence of the chatbot has an effect on group communication with the length of messages increased in chat rooms where the chatbot was present. Moreover, chatbot behavior to rate the students’ answers was correlated with the students’ behavior. The present study offers valuable insights into the optimal strategies for integrating a GenAI Large Language Model into educational tools and computer supported learning.},

Results showed that directed observation led to higher teamwork quality and slightly better usability scores, suggesting it provided a more structured and predictable environment. Both modalities achieved high levels of detail attention and personal reﬂection in learning outcomes, though active participation encouraged slightly greater understanding and engagement. The ﬁndings underscore the potential of collaborative virtual 3D museums to enhance educational experiences, indicating that structured observation can facilitate teamwork and usability.

This research used snowball sampling to solicit 30 online participants of various higher education institutions for qualitative interviews. The learners’ stories were then analyzed using qualitative analysis to identify key themes among them and to build a theory of how learners viewed the role of trust in online social learning. The findings revealed that the learners found themselves in either trusting or trust-compromised social learning groups which positively or negatively impacted their learning outcomes, respectively. We discovered that the interdependence among learners necessitates trust; that trust is universally breached in all social learning contexts but is reconstructed only within trusting groups, and that learners inevitably reach out for help to complete assignments; regardless of their group trust.

To explore the tool’s effectiveness in analyzing scholarly articles, we embarked on an AI-assisted review of research papers, initially using a set of 15 abstracts and 15 full papers. It transpired that InfraNodus could indeed create plausible topical clusters and apparently meaningful patterns from abstracts, but its generated questions and summaries lacked both relevance to and coherence with the articles’ contents, sometimes misconstruing concepts and constructs.

Undergraduate students (n = 90) read an assigned textbook chapter and attended lectures and labs, and then were asked to write a 300-word summary of the lesson content. Data consisted of the essays converted to networks and the end-of-unit multiple choice test. Comparing similarity to the expert network benchmark, the essay networks of those who received anchoring concepts were not significantly different from those who did not. However, those who received the anchoring concepts were significantly more like their peers’ essay networks (mental model convergence) and were more like the networks of the two PowerPoint lectures. Furthermore, those receiving the anchoring concepts performed significantly better on the end-of-unit test than those who did not. Term frequency analysis shows that the most network-central concepts had the greatest frequency in the essays, the other terms’ frequencies were remarkably the same for both the anchoring concepts and no concepts groups, suggesting a similar group-level underlying conceptual mental model of this lesson content. To further explore the influence of anchoring concepts in writing prompts, essays were generated with the same two writing prompts using OpenAI (ChatGPT) and Google Bard (i.e., Gemini). The quality of the essay networks for both AI systems were equivalent to the students’ essay networks. More research is needed to understand how including anchoring concepts in a writing prompt (i.e., prompt engineering) influences students’ essay conceptual structure and subsequent test performance.},

It investigates the issues concerning the integration of Large Language Models into the creative process, by exploiting AI’s linguistic and knowledge-­based skills. The proposed approach envisages a mediated interaction with a semantic space constructed from an extensive catalogue of artistic and critical content. The investigation outlines how the use of AI in the creative cycle can trigger divergent forms of conceptualization, and how these appear as divergent paths in the semantic space. This opens the possibility to qualify the creative process through the traces produced by the interaction with the AI. Since many of the parameters that are relevant in the experimental setting, such as the nature and the arrangement of the knowledge base, the arrangement of the tasks, the conversational traces, and the related semantic paths are, to our knowledge, novel in this form to the scientific investigation, the preliminary results reported here concern mainly the outline of the methodological framework through preliminary experimental results.

The focus is on examining the potential of narrative scenarios to prompt user-driven discussions, using Affective Computing as a case study. Affective Computing, a subfield of AI, is dedicated to recognizing, comprehending, and appropriately responding to human emotions. Its objective is to enhance human-machine interactions by fostering more personalized and emotionally resonant experiences. To envision a scenario where an emotionally intelligent AI becomes a close companion, a multilinear narrative unfolds. This narrative guides the audience through various phases of the protagonist’s life, starting from the initial day of secondary school to the poignant moment of losing a loved one in midlife. The chapter outlines a systematic approach employed to craft and validate this multilinear interactive scenario, followed by the presentation of experimental results involving 164 participants. The overarching aim is to apply this methodology for educational purposes, particularly in fostering ethical contemplation and responsible innovations.},

	abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is an important twenty-first-century skill. Since the edited volume at hand aims to look at artificial intelligence, the relationship between CT and artificial intelligence is first discussed. CT comprises computational concepts, computational practices, and computational perspectives. This chapter aims to investigate the predictors of computational perspectives among high-school students. The hypothesized predictors are grouped into three areas: (1) student characteristics, (2) home environment, and (3) learning opportunities. Computational perspectives are captured with the Computational Thinking Scale (CTS) that comprises five dimensions: creativity, algorithmic thinking, cooperativity, critical thinking, and problem solving. N = 202 high-school students act as the sample, and linear regression is the analysis method used. The best in-sample prediction is possible for algorithmic thinking (R2 = .511). For cooperativity, the explanatory power of our model is rather weak (R2 = .146). Across all five CTS dimensions, CT self-concept is the best predictor for computational perspectives. There are also findings that contradict the developed hypotheses. Mathematics skills negatively predicted creativity. The association between reasoning ability and cooperativity was negative, contrary to evidence that more intelligent individuals are better at cooperating. Moreover, critical thinking was negatively associated with the duration of computer use. The results are compared with findings from a study that relies on a performance test to measure CT.},

Research indicates that early exposure to listening activities significantly influences the development of these skills, particularly in preschool-aged children, given their rapidly evolving cognitive and linguistic capacities. This qualitative study investigates the efficacy of employing metacognitive strategies within storytelling sessions to enhance listening comprehension among preschoolers in Kepong, Malaysia. Data collection involved a combination of interview, checklist and anecdotal observations across three storytelling sessions, capturing the engagement of six participating children. The study was structured in two phases: Phase 1 encompassed the collection of baseline data regarding teaching methodologies and encountered challenges, while Phase 2 focused on the implementation of tailored metacognitive strategies to assess English listening comprehension skills among the children. The findings reveal that the integration of metacognitive techniques positively impacts preschoolers’ listening comprehension abilities. This research contributes to the existing literature by offering insights into the specific application of metacognition within storytelling contexts, highlighting its potential to foster enhanced comprehension skills among young learners. By addressing this gap in the literature, this study underscores the significance of metacognitive approaches in early childhood education, particularly within multicultural settings such as those found in Kepong, Malaysia.},

This study investigates literature (N = 176) related to the use of virtual reality and augmented reality in teacher preparation. This literature review seeks to examine 11 years of empirical work as a foundation for current and future teacher preparation practice. Studies surveyed vacillate between the use of extended reality (augmented reality, virtual reality or mixed reality) either related to specific content delivery or attitudes toward the use of augmented or virtual reality. A key finding is that preservice teachers who are exposed to extended reality as part of their preparation programs develop skills, acceptance and comfort with such technological innovation. Implications are discussed for increased low risk, experiential learning opportunities which serve to support increased teacher self-efficacy and educator retention.},

	abstract = {This chapter explores a Use-Modify-Create approach in assisting students’ mathematical problem-solving skills through mathematical thinking (MT), computational thinking (CT), and programming activities. The approach aims to gradually introduce students to new challenges and concepts through three stages of learning: Use, modify and create, within a mathematical educational context. The research design is a case study conducted in the context of a first-year undergraduate course on programming with applications in mathematics. Data collection involves participant observation of students’ mathematical problem solving, wherein the researcher assumes the roles of teacher and group activity facilitator. The observations are carried out in eight separate sessions with students at the undergraduate level, solving a mathematical task. Data analysis adopts an inductive strategy based on the interplay between the Use-Modify-Create framework and the empirical data. The main findings of the study are threefold. Firstly, the connections between MT, CT, and programming prove weak for most students. Secondly, while some students claim that the Use-Modify-Create approach has supported their understanding to some extent, its overall impact remains unclear. Thirdly, the teacher’s role as a mediator and facilitator is crucial to students’ progress. Implications drawn from the results aim to enhance students’ mathematical problem-solving skills through better design and implementation of the Use-Modify-Create approach, particularly in integrating MT, CT, and programming.},

	abstract = {High school students in rural and semi-rural areas are disadvantaged because their schools struggle to attract and retain instructors who are qualified to teach career and technology courses that ready students for the knowledge economy. The effects of the pandemic moved much knowledge-economy work online by adopting study-from-home (SFH) models; however, educational institutions have been slow to validate corresponding study-from-home instructional models. In response, the current study developed study-from-home instruction using a multimedia-enabled, serialized worked-example artifact to teach financial accounting and modeling for high school students. The study featured grounded theories that inform the design of SFH instruction and online facilitation for a yearlong study. The instruction aimed to promote the far transfer of domain-specific, career-development knowledge regarding financial accounting and modeling. To do so, authors conducted a quasi-experiment with 50 students from five public high schools in rural and semi-rural East Texas. The result shows that socially situated SFH instruction whose design follows the principles of cognitive load theory, situated learning, and cognitive apprenticeship promoted mastery-of-learning outcomes over the course of an academic year. Our findings indicate a promising new direction in the design of remote instruction that delivers complex content to small-screen mobile devices for high school students.},

Online self-assessments can stimulate self-reflection on current learning experiences, a phase of self-regulated learning behavior, and can manifest itself in more elaborate self-reflection knowledge. It was hypothesized that self-reflection knowledge stimulated by an online self-assessment is relat­ ed to individual mastery and work avoidance goals (H1) and is associated with experiencing motivational expectancy discrepancy as well as uncertainty about the appropriate study choice (H2). These two hypotheses were tested on a sample of 299 student teachers. The findings showed that mastery goals favored self-knowledge about the learning situation through an online self-assessment, but work avoidance goals were not related to it. An increased self-reflection knowledge stimulated by an online self-assessment was also associated with the experience of a positive motivational expectation discrepancy, but not with uncertainty about the appropriate study choice.},

A survey filled by faculty members confirmed that the “understand students’ coding status” objective was sufficiently satisfied, and that the system helped faculty members provide appropriate guidance and timely advice to students. In addition, we created and evaluated a multiple regression analysis model using the operation logs from the programming exercise system for predictions and effective feedback provision to students. With the model, we could predict final exam scores using system operation logs from the early-­ stages of the course. Additionally, we could update the score predictions based on each week’s class logs and provide feedback to students. This predictive model has implications for educational practice and allows for timely interventions for learner success. Furthermore, we confirmed the model’s good performance by comparing the scores predicted using past data with the actual scores. The study is particularly strong in identifying key variables and presenting detailed statistical analyses. This makes its conclusions both valuable and actionable for educators.

	abstract = {High attrition/dropout rates and low engagement have been major concerns of online educators. This study examined female high school students' cognitive engagement and disengagement in an online learning context during the COVID-19 pandemic through the lens of self-determination theory's basic psychological needs. We investigated an extended dual-process motivation mediation model that emphasizes the mediating role of the need for competence, including an additional factor, technology self-efficacy, in a South Korean high school context (n = 235). Results from structural equation modelling provided evidence for the proposed model. Our findings indicated that the exogenous variables (ie, perceived autonomy support, perceived teacher control and technology self-efficacy) predicted cognitive engagement and disengagement with the mediating role of competence need satisfaction and competence need frustration. We found distinct processes including (a) “autonomy support-competence need satisfaction-cognitive engagement”, (b) “teacher control-competence need frustration-cognitive disengagement”, (c) “technology self-efficacy-competence need satisfaction-cognitive engagement” and (d) “technology self-efficacy-competence need frustration (negative effect)-cognitive disengagement”. This study suggests using autonomy support strategies to fulfil students' competence needs in online learning contexts. We also found a possible role of technology self-efficacy in influencing psychological competence needs, cognitive engagement and cognitive disengagement in online learning contexts. Implications of the findings are discussed. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic High attrition/dropout rates and low engagement have been major concerns of online educators. Emergency remote teaching (ERT) has implications for online teaching beyond the ERT paradigm. Self-determination theory (SDT) has been adopted and adapted with the goal of determining how to achieve need satisfaction, optimize learner motivation and enhance student engagement in classroom settings. What this paper adds This study applied a dual-process motivation mediation model to investigate both cognitive engagement and disengagement among female high school students in an ERT online learning environment. The extended dual-process motivation mediation model examined the role of an additional factor, technology self-efficacy in cognitive engagement and disengagement in online learning. This study examined the role of direct, indirect and cross-over effects focusing on both bright and dark aspects of the dual-process motivation mediation model in online learning in a South Korean girls' high school during ERT. Implications for practice and/or policy This study proposes the use of autonomy support strategies in online learning contexts. Teachers should understand their students and provide support that addresses competence need satisfaction to enhance student cognitive engagement in online learning contexts. More efforts should be made to prepare teachers for designing online learning experiences that increase students' competence need satisfaction and decrease competence need frustration.},

	abstract = {Student engagement is a multidimensional construct, indicates actual learning experiences and is affected by emotions. Negative and positive achievement emotions play an important role in engagement. In the light of Control-Value Theory and the Extended Process Model of Emotion Regulation, a model was developed and tested to investigate the relationship between student engagement and the antecedents of emotions. Participants consisted of 1450 pre-service teachers who were enrolled in degree programs at Faculties of Education in Turkey. The structural equation modeling method was used to test two research models developed for positive and negative achievement emotions. In the negative achievement emotions model, student engagement was influenced by control of learning beliefs, task value, negative achievement emotions, and reappraisal strategy, and these variables together explained 83.1\% of the total variance in engagement. In the positive achievement emotions model, results revealed the effect of control of learning beliefs, task value, positive achievement emotions, and reappraisal strategy on student engagement, and these variables together explained 97.3\% of the total variance in engagement. The findings have implications for expanding the theoretical knowledge about emotions and emotion regulation strategies to improve student engagement in online learning environments. This study suggests that it is important to pay attention to task value and emotions when designing online instruction and online learning materials and courses.},

This change is not only brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, but it also presents difficulties for low-income and developing countries that have adopted online education for students who are spread out over a wide area. Students from low-income and developing countries, where the teaching and learning process is limited to a classroom environment, are struggling to adjust to online learning. This study aims to shed light on the multifaceted dimensions of the students’ educational journey, their adaptation to alternative learning environments, and the intricate interplay between sociocultural factors and individual identity trajectories within the Nepalese context. Based on indepth interviews with 15 graduate students who were also school teachers, the study found that student’s identities underwent some instability as tension arose between their self-perception in face-to-face and online learning. The students experienced changes in who they were in the face-to-face classroom and who they are in online learning, as well as changes in how society viewed them as online learners.},

A total of 477 participants completed structured questionnaires, and descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to test the hypotheses, which does not require normality or homogeneity of variance assumptions. Results suggest that online learning, particularly the use of recorded lectures, offers several benefits for management undergraduates, including improved learning outcomes, flexibility and control, and access to a wider range of learning resources. The study also found that there is no significant difference in perceived benefits between male and female management undergraduates. These findings highlight the potential of online learning to enhance student learning outcomes and improve education quality in management. To enhance the effectiveness of online learning, educators should focus on creating engaging and interactive courses that promote active learning and student engagement. Additionally, institutions should invest in educator training and support to ensure that they are equipped with the necessary skills and knowledge to deliver effective online courses.},

	abstract = {It is pointed out that one of the main problems of online learning environments is determining whether students engage or not. As engagement is a complex and multifaceted concept, researchers have stated that engagement is effected by many factors (environmental conditions and learner characteristics) and changes according to the context. Among these factors, discovering the effects of emotions experienced in learning processes on engagement has drawn attention recently. It is stated that there is an effect of emotions on engagement. However, the mechanisms underlying the effect of emotions experienced in online learning environment on student engagement have not yet been discovered, and what potential mediator and/or moderator variables might explain this effect. Therefore, this study aims to establish whether emotions predicted student engagement through their effect on the online learning readiness, and whether the strength of this effect was a function of metacognition. The study group includes 1601 university students. Data were gathered via online survey. The moderated mediation models were analyzed with PROCESS macro. The results displayed that emotions are powerful predictors of online learning readiness. Online readiness mediated the effect of emotions on student engagement in three models. Metacognition moderated the positive emotions and negative emotions model but did not moderate the exploratory emotions model. As a result; the direct effect of emotions on both readiness and engagement reveal the need for strategies to enable students to experience positive and exploratory emotions and to reduce negative emotions in learning environments. This study reveals that increasing students’ positive and exploratory emotions and reducing their negative emotions, ensuring their online learning readiness and high metacognition have an impact on online student engagement. Therefore, with the results of this study, it can be stated that taking into account students’ emotions, readiness and metacognition in the design of online learning environment and activities may have a positive effect on student engagement.},

	abstract = {In formal educational settings, such as online university lectures, instructional videos often consist of PowerPoint slides accompanied by a video or audio explanation from the instructor. It has been assumed that the social cues provided by the instructor’s video may facilitate affective processes and affect learning outcomes. Research on instructor presence in instructional videos has focused primarily on laboratory and online studies that are not embedded in the courses in which learners are enrolled. Therefore, we present three field studies examining instructor presence in instructional videos embedded in higher education courses to strengthen external validity (exam-relevant topic, {\textgreater} 30 min long, personally known instructor). The results of these studies show positive effects of a visible instructor compared to no visible instructor on some affective measures: social presence in Study 1 (n = 18, d = .85) and well-being in Study 3 (n = 38, d = 1.01), but not on others (well-being in Studies 1 \& 2 (n = 53); motivation in Studies 1–3, social presence in Studies 2 \& 3). They also show no effects on extraneous processing or learning outcomes (Studies 1–3). Thus, no general effect of instructor presence can be shown for instructional videos embedded in university courses in higher education, but there are also no detrimental effects. This leads to implications for future research, teaching, and design practice.},

	abstract = {Background  The positive effects of active and passive music activities on older people with dementia are well and largely documented by the literature. Nevertheless, the use of music as a non-pharmacological intervention is not so common both in private and public older people care facilities because in-home staff have no competencies for delivering such activities. Conversely, the realization and implementation of a co-designed music-based curriculum for dementia care professionals may help the diffusion of music in the older people care facilities. This study was aimed at evaluating the learning outcomes of the SOUND training, based on an original co-designed musicbased curriculum for dementia care professionals and implemented in Italy, Portugal and Romania.
Methods  The SOUND training study was developed through three phases: a) the co-design of the music-based curriculum for dementia care professionals, involving 55 people in the three participating countries; b) the teaching of the training curriculum to 63 dementia care professionals (29 in Italy, 17 in Portugal and 17 in Romania), delivered both in person and via a Moodle platform named Virtual Music Circle; c) the learning outcomes assessment, carried out by means of 13 self-evaluation tests, and a practical test, and the trainees’ course evaluation by a questionnaire.
Results  Most of the trainees reached the highest score in the evaluation of the theoretical competencies in the three study countries. Conversely, some practical competencies in the facilitation of music activities need to be fine-tuned. The SOUND training course was evaluated very positively in the overall structure, theoretical contents, and practical workshops by the trainees. Nevertheless, they preferred the face-to-face compared to the distance learning methodology in the three countries.
Conclusions  The SOUND training curriculum was effective in teaching music techniques and neurocognitive knowledge to dementia care professionals. Nevertheless, future courses should be differentiated for dementia care professionals with or without previous music knowledge and competencies. Moreover, the course is fully sustainable, because it does not require additional costs given that the curriculum is fully accessible online and it is also replicable because it trains professionals who can continue to apply the method in their working routine.},

Understanding the effect of this multiattributional diversity on CSCL groups is necessary to inform the design of interventions aimed at managing CSCL group diversity. We used topic modeling to investigate how multiattributional diversity affects discussion topics and subsequent group performance. Twenty topics were derived by Latent Dirichlet Allocation and assigned to 17,720 forum posts by 342 groups of psychology freshmen. Multiattributional sociodemographic diversity was negatively related to the number of posts in two topics concerned with time management and feedback mechanisms in groups where multiattributional task-related diversity was also high. These topics were positively related to subsequent group performance ratings. Findings suggest that this combination of diversity presents a risk for group communication, potentially negatively impacting performance.},

We performed structural equation modelling (SEM) to examine the relationships among three environmental factors (fairness, innovation, and social relationships), two intrinsic motivational factors (self-efficacy, outcome expectations), and students’ intent to engage in CL. The findings indicate that building a collaborative climate where students perceive fairness, innovation, and warm social relationships in the classroom facilitates their intention to engage in CL. In addition, students’ intent is influenced by their belief in their ability to engage in CL activities (selfefficacy) and their outcome expectations. The findings have several implications for developing the theory of CL and educational policymaking.},

The purpose of the systematic review is to find out the media and context used in the TPACK framework for the development of science learning. Media is related to learning technology such as technology in communication, collaboration, assessment, visualization, and online learning. The use of science learning media in developing TPACK consists of two types, the first using a single type of media and the second using multiple types of learning technology media. The learning context includes micro in the form of classes, meso in the form of schools, and macro in the form of the wider community, as well as the context of teachers and pre-service teachers. The context of science education in TPACK relates to the type of research such as micro-level using mixed research methods, experimental, qualitative, research and development, and macro level usually using survey research. The TPACK framework is an approach to explaining effectiveness, evaluation, and reflection in the use of learning technology.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Despite the growing interest in using multimodal data to analyse students' actions in Computers‐Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) settings, studying teacher's orchestration load in such settings remains overlooked. The notion of classroom orchestration, and orchestration load, offer a lens to study the implications of increasingly complex technology‐supported learning environments on teacher performance. A combination of multimodal data may aid in understanding teachers' orchestration actions and, as a result, gain insights regarding the orchestration load teachers perceive in scripted CSCL situations. Studying teacher orchestration load in CSCL helps understand the workload teachers experience while facilitating student collaboration and assists in informing design decisions for teacher supporting tools. In this paper, we collect and analyse data from different modalities (i.e. electrodermal activity, observation notes, log data, dashboard screen recordings and responses to self‐reported questionnaires) to study teachers' orchestration load in scripted CSCL. A tool called PyramidApp was used to deploy CSCL activities and a teacher‐facing dashboard was used to facilitate teachers in managing collaboration in real time. The findings of the study show the potential of multimodal data analysis in investigating and estimating the orchestration load experienced by teachers in scripted CSCL activities. Study findings further demonstrate factors emerging from multimodal data such as task type, activity duration, and number of students influenced teachers' orchestration load.},

	abstract = {Online learning has evolved into a transformative approach, offering benefits such as enhanced accessibility and a flexible learning experience. Educational institutions welcome this innovative method for teaching and learning (PdP) purposes. However, there are some issues that result from the lack of in-person engagement, which hinders the growth of interpersonal skills, and technological obstacles, which cause disparities, underline the limitations of the method, emerge as an urgent problem statement. The challenge lies in finding a harmonious balance between the advantages of online learning, such as enhanced accessibility and flexible learning experiences, and the critical need for face-to-face interaction that fosters interpersonal skills. Additionally, addressing technological barriers becomes essential to ensure a more equitable and inclusive educational landscape. Despite these obstacles, the adaptability of online learning is particularly evident in times of crisis, requiring a balanced perspective to fully exploit its potential for effective and inclusive education. Therefore, The purpose of this study is to determine the social skills and online collaborative learning usage levels of UTHM students, as well as to investigate the correlation between these factors. Using online surveys and questionnaires, Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia (UTHM) obtained data from 203 respondents for quantitative study. Using the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS), the quantitative data will be analysed and the results will be presented as frequency, percentage, mean, and standard deviation. Notably, there is a substantial link between all the factors with social skills, with the highest correlation coefficient observed in the interaction aspect, reaching 0.904.},

Within the target group and context analysis of the AI\_VET project, guided interviews with N = 48 stakeholders from vocational education and training were conducted and analyzed. The results reveal an ambiguous and rather superficial understanding of AI within the target group as well as a limited incorporation of AI into vocational practice despite a broad consensus regarding its increasing relevance. Recommendations for the design of online learning resources include a focus on AI basics to promote a foundational understanding, consideration of opportunities, risks and limitations in professional contexts, and the use of specific application examples. Building on this, the AI\_VET course series was implemented through a participatory approach. Initial evaluation results suggest differentiated usage of the course modules and acceptance among learners. The article concludes with a discussion of implications for the further integration of AI in vocational education and training, as well as the positioning of the developed offerings in AI education.

Im Rahmen der Zielgruppen- und Kontextanalyse des Projekts AI\_VET wurden leitfadengestützte Interviews mit N = 48 Stakeholder*innen aus der beruflichen Bildung durchgeführt und ausgewertet. Die Ergebnisse zeigen ein diffuses und eher oberflächliches Verständnis von KI innerhalb der Zielgruppe sowie eine mangelnde Verankerung von KI in der beruflichen Praxis, trotz eines breiten Konsenses hinsichtlich ihrer zunehmenden Relevanz. Konkrete Impulse für die Gestaltung von onlinebasierten Lernangeboten sind die Ausrichtung auf KI-Grundlagen, die Auseinandersetzung mit Chancen, Risiken und Limitationen in beruflichen Kontexten sowie die Nutzung konkreter Anwendungsbeispiele. Auf dieser Basis wurde die Kursreihe AI\_VET in einem partizipativen Ansatz implementiert. Erste Evaluationsergebnisse deuten auf eine differenzierte Nutzung der Kursbausteine sowie auf Akzeptanz von Seiten der Lernenden hin. Implikationen für die weitere Verankerung von KI in der beruflichen Bildung sowie die Einordnung der Angebote in den Kontext der KI-Bildung werden diskutiert.},

This research aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the i-Genius module in enhancing students’ performance in science. The i-Genius module’s development adhered to the ADDIE model, and two specific research questions were formulated: i) is there a statistically significant difference in mean scores between the experimental and control groups? and ii) to what extent can i-Genius contribute to students’ conceptual evolution compared to traditional methods? To address these questions, a sequential mixed-method approach involving interviews, pre-tests, and post-tests was implemented in two distinct schools in the Seremban District. The experimental group comprised 35 participants, and the control group also included 35 students with similar characteristics. Student performance, assessed through pre-test and post-test mean scores, revealed that students exposed to i-Genius achieved significantly higher scores than those exposed to traditional methods in the post-test (t(68)=8.37, p{\textless}0.05). This study’s implications lie in its practical application within the school context, offering an alternative instructional tool for teaching science and presenting an instructional model to guide teachers in formulating strategies that encourage problem-posing within the science curriculum.},

Results: The findings were synthesized into four themes: ‘Navigating uncharted waters under never-­ending pressure’, ‘Balancing on the brink of an abyss’, ‘Sacrificing the few to save the many’ and ‘Bracing for the next wave’. Frontline decision-­making during a pandemic contribute to ethical dilemmas while necessitating difficult prioritizations to adapt and respond to limited resources. Learning was manifested through effective information sharing and the identification of successful adaptations as compared to maladaptations.
Conclusions: During pandemics or under other extreme conditions, decisions must be made promptly, even amidst emerging chaos, potentially necessitating the use of untested methods and ad-h­ oc solutions due to initial lack of knowledge and guidelines. Within ambulance care, dynamic leadership becomes imperative, combining autonomous frontline decision-­making with support from management. Strengthening ethical competence and fostering ethical discourse may enhance confidence in decision-­making, particularly under ethically challenging circumstances.},

However, the divergent findings surrounding the efficacy of adaptive collaborative scripts engendered a compelling need for a comprehensive understanding of the adaptive scripts. This study explored the effectiveness of adaptive scripts through a systematic analysis of 11 meticulously chosen studies and demonstrated the distinct contributions offered by varying types of adaptive collaborative scripts (namely, fading-out scripts, adaptable scripts, and self-adaptive scripts). The results underscored adaptive scripts yielded a favorable impact on the caliber of collaboration and on learners’ psychological contentment. Nonetheless, the ramifications on learning outcomes were inconclusive. Under the guidance of activity theory, this review uncovered the optimal application conditions of each variant of adaptive script. The fading-out scripts necessitated supplementary consistent support to ensure satisfactory learning outcomes. Adaptable scripts demonstrated stable efficacy when employed for students with good self-regulation ability. The self-adaptive scripts yielded optimal results in learning activities with higher-level educational objectives. Distributed roles within learning groups and perceived adaptivity also influenced the efficacy of self-adaptive scripts. Implications, limitations, and future directions were also provided.},

This quantitative study collected questionnaire and behavioural log data from 39 learners and examined the interplay between achievement goal motivation and metacognitive skills within an online social annotation envir­ onment. Findings revealed that mastery goal orientation positively correlated with metacognitive planning and regulation, while per­ formance goal orientation was predominantly associated with metacognitive regulation.

Although off-the-shelf and standardized tests are widely accepted for large-scale tests and classroom assessments, guiding learning and assessing learners’ progress is also needed. Advances in cognitive psychology have led to an in-depth understanding of how learners acquire and use knowledge. Researchers faced the challenges that determining how this information can be used following the purposes of the assessment although emerging technologies make it possible to capture complex performances. Frameworks include design principles to support educational assessments in online learning environments. In this context, there is a need for assessment designs that add the traces left by learners in technology-supported environments to the assessment process. The evidence-­ centered design (ECD) framework provides a conceptual design framework that supports a wide variety of assessment types. This study aims to: (a) provide an overview of the ECD and (b) provide an example of how the ECD is used for learning-­centered assessment design. This study’s purpose is to overcome the difficulties of designing new assessment forms, guide the emergence of new assessment approaches, mediate how assessment design should be suitable for the complex nature of learning, and use the data from learners in the context of assessment analytics holistically. A typical assessment design architecture will also require different experts to work collaboratively.},

With a goal to support and improve the assessment process, assessment analytics involves deriving meaningful insights from assessment data related to student knowledge and instructional effectiveness. However, when students utilize machine learning to complete online assessments, the validity of assessment data as an accurate representation of student knowledge diminishes. This chapter explores the strategic use of online formative assessments to both enhance understanding of student knowledge and deter the inappropriate use of AI. While there is always a risk of academic dishonesty, online formative assessments offer a unique avenue for teachers to gather empirical evidence of student engagement, current comprehension, and critical thinking. By adopting the PICS framework for personalized, informal, constructivist, and short online formative assessments, educators can harness assessment analytics to gain valid and valuable insights into student knowledge. This approach facilitates proactive engagement with students who may be grappling with content and tempted to seek assistance from artificial intelligence, fostering meaningful conversations that aim to address learning challenges and promote academic integrity in online education.},

This chapter delves into the nuances of dentistry education within these three categories, exploring aspects such as history, admission requirements, curriculum, teaching strategies, assessment methods, practical experiences, accreditation, and more. The study also examines the impact of socioeconomic factors on students and faculty, workforce dynamics, access to education, online learning, and community engagement. In high-income countries, dentistry education has a long history with stringent admission requirements and comprehensive curricula. Teaching strategies blend traditional methods with advanced technologies, and a wide array of resources are available. However, high costs, oversupply of professionals, and disparities in access to care pose challenges. Middle-income countries have made strides in dental education, offering balanced curricula with a strong clinical focus. These nations strive for equitable access and invest in community outreach programs. Limited resources and faculty shortages remain challenges, but partnerships with high-income countries contribute to progress. Low-income developing countries face resource constraints but prioritize practical skills development and community-based training. Efforts are underway to enhance quality and achieve accreditation with international support. Dental education in these countries not only addresses workforce shortages but also promotes access to care among marginalized populations. Interprofessional education is gaining traction, emphasizing collaboration with other healthcare providers. Intraprofessional education promotes teamwork within the dental profession itself. This chapter underscores the need for international collaboration, resource allocation, and research capacity building. Achievements include producing competent dental professionals and addressing oral health disparities, while challenges encompass ﬁnancial constraints, access disparities, and faculty shortages. By promoting research, exploring innovative teaching methods, and bridging access gaps, dental education can continue to evolve and contribute to improved global oral health.},

	abstract = {Background  Blended learning comprised with flipped classroom (FC) and “internet plus” is a new learning strategy that reverses the position of teacher and students in class, and provides abundant learning resources before and after class. This study aimed to assess the impact of blended learning on learning outcomes in evidence-based medicine course, and compare with traditional learning method.
Methods  The participants of the two groups were from two difference cohorts in Air force medical university in China. The two groups toke the same pre-test before class and then were given the teaching of same chapters of evidence-based medicine with two different learning strategy. In the blended learning group, the participants were required to create a debriefing slide about their learning outcomes and the answers of questions given in advance after study the learning material sent by teacher a week before class, and the teacher gave a detailed summary based on the common problems, and distributed multimedia resources for review. After the experiment was carried out, learning outcomes including mastering knowledge, learning satisfaction, and self-evaluation were compared.
Results  37 and 39 participants were enrolled to blended learning and traditional learning groups, respectively, and no statistically significant difference were found in baseline information and pre-test grades. Statistically significant differences were found in learning outcomes including post-test score (t = 2.90, p = 0.005), changes of scores between pre-test and post-test (t = 2.49, p = 0.022), learning satisfaction (t = 12.41, p = 0.001), and self-evaluation of the two groups (t = 7.82, p = 0.001). Especially, the changes of scores between pre-test and post-test of blended learning and traditional learning groups were 4.05 (4.26), and 2.00 (2.85), respectively.
Conclusions  This study showed that compared with traditional learning strategy, blended learning can effectively enhanced participants’ acquisition of knowledge, learning satisfaction, and self-evaluation in evidence-based medicine. Using blended learning method including “internet plus” and flipped classroom is recommended in the teaching of evidence-based medicine course.},

	abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in enhancing online learning through features like automated question-answering systems. These systems can identify and respond to prevalent learner queries, thereby personalizing and enriching the online educational experience. However, there remains a notable gap in research regarding the performance of different models in educational settings, particularly in evaluating AI-generated content using explainable metrics. This study evaluates two distinct language models, Llama3-8B and GPT-2 small, to determine which better supports educational objectives in online environments. We used a t-test to statistically assess differences in the Flesch-Kincaid readability scores between the two models and the results indicate that both models perform well in providing support for Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) learners regarding their readability. We further conducted an explainable analysis of the content generated by both models, the results show that although both models can generate certain support, there is still much improvement for the comprehension and accuracy of these generated contents. Our findings recommend that the selection of an AI model for educational use should be tailored to the specific learning goals and needs of the audience. Moreover, this study underscores the importance of applying explainable and transparent metrics for assessing AI-generated content to ensure its educational efficacy and ethical integrity.},

	abstract = {Blended learning (BL), a teaching method merging online and face-to-face learning, is lauded for its potential to enrich educational outcomes and tackle challenges entrenched in conventional teaching practices. In countries like Pakistan, where equitable access to quality professional development remains an obstacle, BL is a promising avenue to surmount training barriers. While BL adoption has evolved swiftly, research into its integration within teacher training remains limited. Notably, no comprehensive model exists describing the motivational factors influencing teachers’ perceptions and intentions regarding the blended mode of teacher training. This study aims to identify the motivational elements that motivate schoolteachers in teacher training in­ stitutions in Pakistan to incorporate blended learning into their programs. The motivational factors identified in BL literature have been employed to craft a motivation model grounded in their causal relationship. This quantitative study examines the interplay between multiple motivational factors and their impact on BL adoption within teacher training and the BL envi­ ronment. Surveying 350 schoolteachers (participants) from teacher training institutions, we employed Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) techniques with Smart PLS 4.0 for data analysis. Results reveal that extrinsic and intrinsic motivational factors significantly influence teachers’ motivation to adopt BL for training. Notably, "overall training quality" and "educational envi­ ronment" were non-influential. Overall, the findings underscore that considering a blend of extrinsic and intrinsic factors can wield a 65 \% influence on BL adoption. The study’s results provide practical guidance for educational leaders, curriculum designers, and faculty members aiming to cultivate a unified blended learning environment for teacher professional development. These insights also underscore the importance of incorporating essential motivational factors into forthcoming blended learning training programs.},

            Viele Schweizer KMU und Großunternehmen sind bemüht, die Zusammenarbeit im Rahmen der Digitalisierung zwischen Mitarbeitenden und Arbeitgebenden zu fördern. Der Druck auf dem Arbeitsmarkt steigt, als ansprechende und innovative Arbeitgebende zu bestehen. Alte Hierarchien und Dienstwege, welche sich bewährt haben, werden zunehmend an agile Organisationsformen angepasst, was wiederum Flexibilität und eine Veränderung des Führungsverständnisses erfordert. Um den Herausforderungen des Wandels zu begegnen, wurde sich auf drei relevante Dimensionen, welche die Arbeitswelt 4.0 beeinflussen, fokussiert: People, Technology und Place. Diese Fokussierung soll den Unternehmen dabei helfen, die Transformation in die agile und digitale Welt zu erleichtern und die Resultate der Veränderung zu steuern. Zur Zielerreichung, welche Chancen bei der Einführung der neuen Arbeitswelt entstehen können, wurden Interviews durchgeführt, wobei die Teilnehmenden aus unterschiedlichen Branchen stammen. Zur Datenerhebung wurde ein teilstrukturierter Interviewleitfaden genutzt. Auf Basis der gewonnenen Erkenntnisse wurden anschließend Empfehlungen ausgearbeitet. Es konnte eruiert werden, dass die öffentliche Verwaltung vor allem Chancen im Bereich der Flexibilisierung der Arbeitsstrukturen aufweist, welche sich positiv auf die Positionierung am Arbeitsmarkt und die Mitarbeitendenbindung auswirkt. Zudem können durch unterschiedliche Raumzonen die Anforderungen an die verschiedenen Arbeitsweisen gedeckt werden. Die Technologie ist zwar ein wichtiger Enabler der neuen Arbeitswelt, birgt allerdings auch große Herausforderungen im Management der verschiedenen Tools. Zu guter Letzt spielt das Thema Führung eine wesentliche Rolle, ob die Transformation in die neue Arbeitswelt glückt oder nicht.},

            Der Einzelhandel ist nicht erst seit der Corona-Pandemie starken Veränderungen unterworfen. Geändertes Konsumverhalten und die Digitalisierung erfordern, dass sich die Anbieter anpassen, um auch künftig noch erfolgreich zu sein. Neben den stationären Absatzkanälen werden Vertriebskanäle über das Internet immer wichtiger. Sind alle Kanäle übergreifend geführt, hoch vernetzt, stark kundenfokussiert und ermöglichen ein kanalübergreifendes Einkaufserlebnis, spricht man von einer Omni-Channel-Strategie. Im Beitrag erfolgt eine Analyse der Situation im Schweizer Non-Food-Detailhandel mit Fokus auf die Fragen, welche Strategien sich bei der Transformation der Vertriebsstrukturen und -aktivitäten etabliert haben, welche für die Zukunft zu erwarten sind, und welche Voraussetzungen für die erfolgreiche Umsetzung von Omni-Channel-Strategien nötig sind. Auf Basis einer empirischen Erhebung wird ein Modell entwickelt, das Unternehmen dabei helfen soll, eine solche Strategie generieren und implementieren zu können.},

            Der vorliegende Beitrag diskutiert die Innovationsmetode „Hackathon“ im Anwendungskontext des öffentlichen Sektors. Abgeleitet aus den Konzepten Open Government und Open Innovation wird aus der Literatur ein Überblick gegeben werden, inwieweit Innovationswettbewerbe wie ein Hackathon geeignet sind, Innovationsideen aus der Gesellschaft in die Verwaltung zu bringen und die digitale Transformation des öffentlichen Sektors zu unterstützen. Anschließend werden die Ergebnisse präsentiert, welche im Nachgang zu den erstmals vom Kanton Bern initiierten Data Hackdays 2021 geführt worden waren. Der Hackathon hat insbesondere das Potenzial, dass in der Vorbereitung gewohnte Arbeitsweisen und Routinen verlassen werden und am Anlass selber eine Auseinandersetzung mit einer interessierten Community ermöglicht wird. Die Resultate zeigen auch Schwierigkeiten in der Vorbereitung auf, welche allerdings mit zunehmender Erfahrung zu bewältigen sind.},

            Die Schweiz weist im internationalen Vergleich von digitalen Dienstleistungen der öffentlichen Verwaltung (e-Government) großes Verbesserungspotenzial auf. Insbesondere die Basisdienstleistungen sind vergleichsweise wenig digitalisiert. Ausgehend von der theoretischen Grundlage zur Verwaltungsdigitalisierung sowie zu Erfolgsfaktoren der Digitalisierung, ordnet der Beitrag den Stand der Schweiz im internationalen Vergleich ein. Darauf aufbauend wird anschließend der Digitalisierungsgrad aus personeller, technologischer und organisatorischer Perspektive in ausgewählten Berner Gemeinden empirisch untersucht.

            Im Zuge der Corona-Pandemie wurde ersichtlich, dass das Konzept der „Green Logistics“ an Bedeutung gewinnen wird, weil im E-Commerce Just-in-time-Bestellungen anhaltend bedeutend sein werden. Die Forderung nach Nachhaltigkeit setzt die Wirtschaft generell aber speziell die Logistikbranche vor die Herausforderung, ressourceneffizient zu produzieren oder Dienstleistungen zu erbringen. Kann mit dem Einsatz von digitalen Technologien die erforderliche Ressourceneffizienz verbessert werden? Der Beitrag geht am Beispiel der Transport- und Lagerungslogistik dem Zusammenhang von digitaler Transformation und Nachhaltigkeit nach und zeigt mit einer empirischen Untersuchung in der Schweizer Logistik auf, wie man den Effekt messen kann. Erste Erhebungen weisen auf Branchenebene darauf hin, dass es einen positiven Effekt vom Einsatz digitaler Technologien auf die die ökologische und ökonomische Nachhaltigkeit gibt.},

            Die digitale ID gilt als wichtige Voraussetzung zur Realisierung ökonomischer, sozialer und politischer Potenziale in einer digitalen Welt. Nach der Ablehnung der E-ID-Vorlage in einer Volksabstimmung am 7. März 2021 versucht die Schweizer Politik, im Rahmen der Konzeption neuer E-ID-Lösungen die Interessen von Wissenschaft, Wirtschaft und Zivilgesellschaft besser zu berücksichtigen. Der Beitrag befasst sich mit einem E-ID-Lösungsansatz auf der Basis von Blockchain-Technologie. Die Forschungsergebnisse einer quantitativ-empirischen Befragung unter 1730 Stimmberechtigten zeigen, dass die Bevölkerung einer derartigen Lösung positiv gegenüberstehen würde. Dieser Befund gilt sowohl geschlechter-, sprach- als auch annähernd parteiübergreifend. Ferner zeigt sich, dass die Bevölkerung dem Einsatz der Blockchain-Technologie auch in anderen Anwendungsbereichen nicht generell ablehnend gegenübersteht und die teils vorhandene Skepsis mittels allgemein verständlicher Erklärungen zu überwinden ist.},

	abstract = {Purpose  Online teaching has gained popularity in recent years, but changes have been slower to implement in Lower or Medium Income Countries (LMIC). The aim of this research was to build upon educators’ experiences of remote teaching during Covid-19 to inform the development of a blended learning approach for teaching pre-clinical subjects at the Faculty of Biomedical Sciences at Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Nigeria (OAU).
Methods  The Critical Incident Technique (CIT) was used in this exploratory study. Participants were invited to either complete an online qualitative questionnaire or take part in an online structured interview, which were hosted on Microsoft platforms. Data were obtained from eighteen educators and were analyzed using thematic analysis.
Results  Findings suggest that most educators (72\%) continued to engage with remote teaching post-pandemic. All lab-based practical topics returned to being in-person, and teachers’ experiences highlighted that a new blended learning approach should focus on asynchronized online teaching of didactic subjects. Five main themes captured educators’ experiences and lessons learned regarding online teaching including: skills and training, teachers’ motivation and attitudes, internet and connectivity, learners’ behaviors, and socio-economic constraints.
Conclusion  Findings provided additional evidence on the way in which educators in LMIC would like to build upon the positive aspects of online teaching and move towards a blended learning model. However, the implementation of such an approach should consider students’ and faculty’s needs and socio-economic constraints.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Technology-related professional development (PD) is a crucial strategy to prepare and encourage teachers to integrate technology into their teaching in a high-quality way. During teachers’ participation in technology-related PD, change processes occur from a current to a desired status of technology-enhanced teaching (TET). A higher probability of disruption of TET can be assumed during these change processes. However, previous research on PD is mainly based on cross-sectional data that does not provide insight into such change processes (especially during PD participation). In this study, we examined teachers’ trajectories closely during their participation in a 3-month technology-related online PD (OPD). We conducted a concurrent explanatory mixed-methods approach to analyze longitudinal data from the first four weeks of the OPD, focusing on 23 teachers who completed weekly reflection diaries. Findings from a multilevel framework revealed that most of the variances in the development of teachers’ technology integration (i.e., frequency and quality) and motivation to use technology for teaching (i.e., self-efficacy and utility value) was due to contextual factors. Using linear mixed-effects models, we found a statistically significant decrease in teachers’ quality of TET over time. Analyses of reflections on TET of extreme cases allowed us to identify possible relevant contextual characteristics related to smoother TET: 1) the use of one generic technology across lessons and 2) the use of ready-to-use domain-specific technology. Implications for practice are discussed, such as attention to unintended side effects of teachers’ TET during instructional phases of technology-related OPD.

            Zusammenfassung
            Technologiebezogene Fortbildungen (PD) sind eine bedeutende Strategie, um Lehrkräfte darauf vorzubereiten und zu ermutigen, Technologie in ihren Unterricht lernwirksam zu integrieren. Während der Teilnahme von Lehrkräften an technologiebezogenen PD finden Veränderungsprozesse von einem aktuellen zu einem gewünschten Status technologiegestützten Unterrichts (TET) statt. Während dieser Veränderungsprozesse kann eine höhere Wahrscheinlichkeit für eine Disruption des TET angenommen werden. Die bisherige Forschung zu Fortbildungen basiert jedoch hauptsächlich auf Querschnittsdaten, die keinen Einblick in solche Veränderungsprozesse – insbesondere während der Teilnahme an Fortbildungen – geben. In dieser Studie haben wir Lehrkräfte während ihrer Teilnahme an einer 3‑monatigen technologiebezogenen Onlinefortbildung (OPD) eng begleitet. Wir nutzten einen erklärenden Mixed-Methods-Ansatz zur Auswertung von Längsschnittdaten von 23 Lehrkräften, die wöchentliche Lehrertagebücher anfertigten. Die Ergebnisse eines Mehrebenenmodells zeigten, dass die meiste Varianz in der Entwicklung der Technologieintegration von Lehrkräften (d. h. Häufigkeit und Reibungslosigkeit) und ihrer Motivation für den Einsatz von Technologie im Unterricht (d. h. Selbstwirksamkeit, Nutzenswahrnehmung) in erster Linie vom Kontext abhängen. Unter Verwendung von Modellen mit linearen gemischten Effekten fanden wir einen signifikanten Rückgang des reibungslosen Einsatzes von Technologie. Die Analyse der Reflexionen von Extremfällen über TET ermöglichte es uns, potenziell relevante kontextbezogene Merkmale zu identifizieren: 1) die Verwendung einer generischen Technologie im gesamten Unterricht und 2) die Verwendung einsatzbereiter domänenspezifischer Technologie. Es werden Implikationen für die Praxis erörtert, wie z. B. die Beachtung unbeabsichtigter Nebeneffekte bei der Integration von Technologie in den Unterricht in den Einstiegsphasen von technologiebezogenen Onlinefortbildungen.},

In the context of digital technology, studies point to the importance of training courses dealing with digital-related topics. Little is known, however, about whether teachers’ technology-enhanced instruction or digital competencies vary depending on the training attended. Against this background, the present study investigates relations between speciﬁc digitalrelated training topics, teachers’ digital competence-related beliefs, and technologyenhanced instructional quality. For this purpose, data from 219 teachers were analyzed from an online survey conducted at the beginning of 2023, in which they reported which training courses on digital-related topics they had attended. Crosssectional path models have been run in Mplus, which illustrate that teachers reported higher digital competencies and frequently used digital technology for cognitive activation and constructive support when they reported attending digital-related training topics that combined technological and pedagogical content. In addition, indirect effects were used to show that teachers’ digital competence-related beliefs mediated the relations between trainings on “active media work,” “computer-based student support,” and “subject-speciﬁc instructional development with digital media” and technology-enhanced instructional quality. Practical implications for teacher training in the area of digital technology are derived from the present results.},

	abstract = {Berufliche Anforderungen unterliegen aktuell – nicht zuletzt durch Digitalisierung – vielen Veränderungen. Einerseits wird ein größerer Teil beruflicher (Routine-)Tätigkeiten automatisiert, andererseits stellt die verbleibende Arbeit Beschäftigte vor komplexere Herausforderungen. Noch mehr als bisher haben diese Veränderungen der Arbeitswelt Einfluss auf die berufliche Ausbildung, weil dadurch auch die Anforderungen an Absolvent*innen steigen. Insbesondere wird erwartet, dass sie in der Lage sind, kaufmännische Probleme eigenständig und kompetent zu lösen. In kaufmännischen Curricula spiegelt sich dieses anspruchsvolle Ziel schon länger wider. Curriculare Vorgaben reichen jedoch nicht aus, es muss auch hinreichend Lerngelegenheiten in Betrieb und Berufsschule geben, um diese Kompetenz systematisch zu fördern. Zudem sollte in Abschlussprüfungen Problemlösekompetenz als Teil beruflicher Handlungskompetenz erfasst werden, um Aussagen darüber zu treffen, inwiefern dieses Ziel erreicht wurde. Eine Analyse von Aufgaben aus kaufmännischen Zwischen- und Abschlussprüfungen bei Industriekaufleuten (IK) und Kaufleuten für Büromanagement (KBM) zeigt jedoch, dass überwiegend einfaches (Handlungs-)Wissen abgefragt wird. Aufgaben, die berufliche Problemlösekompetenz erfassen, spielen nur eine untergeordnete Rolle. Ursachen dafür könnten u.a. eine unzureichende Kompetenz in der Entwicklung problemorientierter Aufgaben und fehlende Weiterbildungsangebote zur Förderung dieser Kompetenz bei Prüfenden sein. Daher wurde ein Training entwickelt, durchgeführt und evaluiert, das (angehende) Lehrkräfte und Ausbildende in kaufmännischen Berufen befähigen soll, problemhaltige technologiebasierte Aufgaben zu entwickeln und kritisch mit Blick auf die Messung von Problemlösekompetenz zu reflektieren. Die technologiebasierte Umsetzung wurde gewählt, weil sich damit berufliche Anforderungssituationen authentischer modellieren lassen.},

	abstract = {Background: Collaborative learning is a common teaching strategy in design education. This study analyzes the correlation between personality types, communication styles and the learning outcomes of design students in collaborative learning in online and offline mode of teaching. The traditional approach of face-to-face learning had to be quickly adjusted with hybrid or online mode of teaching and learning process due to the onset of the pandemic COVID-19 during the last 3 years.
Methods: By comparing the data collected from two academic years, the study compares the different correlations in conducting online and offline collaborative learning environments. Students’ personality and communication style are analyzed through the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) and a four-type communication model.
Results: The findings indicate that students face different challenges in online and offline collaborative learning activities, and the correlation between personality types, personality styles and learning outcomes is different. In the offline environment, the personality traits of Thinking (T) and the personality temperament of intuitive-thinking (NT) are positively correlated with learning outcomes. Among the four communication styles, directors are positively correlated with learning outcomes. In an online environment, having the personality trait of extroversion (E) and the personality temperament of intuitivefeeling (NF) are positively connected with learning outcomes. Socializer is a communication style that is closely correlated to learning outcomes.
Conclusion: This study points out that when organizing online collaborative learning, students face challenges in building an intimate and comfortable group atmosphere, while offline learning requires more leadership-quality team members. The findings help educators understand student personalities, help teachers organize learning activities more effectively for better collaborative learning outcomes, and provide students with equal opportunities for learning success.},

	abstract = {This study analyzed collaborative invention projects by teams of lower-secondary (13–14-year-old) Finnish students. In invention projects, student teams design and make materially embodied collaborative inventions using traditional and digital fabrication technologies. This investigation focused on the student teams’ knowledge creation processes by examining how they applied maker practices (i.e., design process, computer engineering, product design, and science practices) in their co-invention projects and the effects of teacher and peer support. In our investigations, we relied on video data and on-site observations, utilizing and further developing visual data analysis methods. Our findings assist in expanding the scope of computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) research toward sociomaterially mediated knowledge creation, revealing the open-ended, nonlinear, and self-organized flow of the co-invention projects that take place around digital devices. Our findings demonstrate the practice-based, knowledge-creating nature of these processes, where computer engineering, product design, and science are deeply entangled with design practices. Furthermore, embodied design practices of sketching, practical experimenting, and working with concrete materials were found to be of the essence to inspire and deepen knowledge creation and advancement of epistemic objects. Our findings also reveal how teachers and peer tutor students can support knowledge creation through co-invention.},

The ﬁrst aim of this article is to analyse the conceptualisations of success in higher education and the key factors that contributed to the academic success of 28 graduates with impairments from 16 German universities. The second aim is to provide recommendations from the participants themselves to other students with impairments and to higher education institutions for improving their success in higher education. The results show that the participants have different conceptualisations of success (achieving a degree, getting good grades, learning and developing skills, gaining practical experience, overcoming challenges and maintaining a balance between studies and health) and identiﬁed various personal factors (the disability as a driving force) and contextual factors (social and family environment, time abroad, positive feedback, recognition of achievements and accessible online courses and digitised materials), as relevant to their success. The ﬁndings further demonstrate that hearing the voices of graduates with impairments is critical to their success in higher education and the empowerment of students with disabilities.},

We derived the questionnaire from the technology acceptance model, which is available for parents and teachers. A pilot study with teacher students (N = 36) resulted in three economically applicable scales probing perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and behavioral intention to use AI-based adaptive learning tools. We tested the factorial and criterion validity of the questionnaire for 223 parents and 141 teachers. Structural equation modelling (SEM) confirmed the hypothesized factor structure for the parents. After removing one item, SEM also supported the expected model structure for the teachers. All scales demonstrated good internal consistencies, and two items related to the constructs showed high criterion validity.},

The article then goes on to present a study in which participants in online courses (N = 1907) were surveyed about their choice of course. The focus was on public adult education centres (Volkshochschule, VHS), the largest adult education provider in Germany. Results showed, that almost half of the online participants could not be classiﬁed as belonging to the regular clientele of VHS. Regarding the decision to participate, the survey also showed that even regular VHS participants sometimes preferred an online course instead of a face-to-face course with the same content.},

	abstract = {Video‐based teacher online learning enables teachers to engage in reflective practice by watching others' classroom videos, providing peer feedback (PF) and reviewing others' work. However, the quality and reliability of PF often suffer due to variations in teaching proficiency among providers, which limits its usefulness for reviewers. To improve the quality of PF, hybrid intelligence is a promising approach that enhances human evaluation with AI‐based techniques. Thus, we developed a hybrid intelligence feedback (HIF) system, where PF is categorized and summarized by large language models (LLM), and accompanied with AI multimodal data analysis, all in accordance with a knowledge structure. To investigate the effectiveness of the HIF, we conducted a study involving 58 pre‐service mathematics teachers. After their initial feedback provision on a classroom video, they were divided into two groups. One group received HIF, while the other received traditional PF. Both groups revised their initial feedback based on the same video with PF or HIF report, and were assigned two tasks, namely in‐depth reflection and extensive reflection. We analysed the reflective writings generated in in‐depth reflection using the Structure of Observed Learning Outcomes taxonomy, and examined the diversity of teachers' attentions in extensive reflection using information entropy. Compared to traditional PF, our findings indicated that HIF (a) facilitated more comments added in feedback revision, (b) promoted multi‐structural and extended abstract level thinking in in‐depth reflection, (c) encouraged more diverse attentions in extensive reflection. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of HIF in enhancing PF to promote reviewers' reflection. This efficacy can be attributed to the utilization of LLM to identify common elements within PF, guided by the human knowledge‐based framework, as well as the integration of data‐driven evidence to complement PF.

                        Video‐based teacher online learning allows teachers to reflect on their own or others' videos flexibly while providing and reviewing peer feedback using reflection tools.
                      
                      
                        While the benefits of reflecting on one's own videos with peer feedback are widely recognized, there is limited empirical evidence supporting the advantages of reflecting on others' videos with peer feedback. The effectiveness of this process may be affected by the quality and reliability of the peer feedback provided.
                      
                      
                        Using natural language processing techniques to enhance peer feedback can be feasible and effective. However, it is primarily used to address textual‐level issues and is less effective in promoting professionalism.
                      
                      
                        Multimodal data analysis has shown effectiveness in enhancing teaching behaviours and facilitating reflection. However, despite the widespread use of AI‐based analysis on classroom videos, they often lack educational interpretations.
                      
                      
                        Hybrid intelligence is a novel concept in learning science research, aiming to leverage both human and machine intelligence to enhance the overall effectiveness.
                      
                    
                  
                  
                    What this paper adds?
                    
                      
                        This study applied the concept of hybrid intelligence to video‐based teacher learning by proposing a hybrid intelligence feedback (HIF) system, aiming to promote teachers' reflection on others' videos during the peer feedback review process.
                      
                      
                        This study proposed the design of HIF module, where human peer feedback was enhanced by large language models, and machine data analysis was complemented with educational interpretations, all structured according to an expert knowledge structure.
                      
                      
                        The results showed that the HIF was effective to stimulate teachers' higher‐level thinking in in‐depth reflection and enhanced the diversity of their attentions in extensive reflection. However, it may still be challenging for novices to comprehend and integrate newly noticed pedagogical strategies in the HIF with their internal knowledge structures during reflection.
                      
                    
                  
                  
                    Implications for practice and/or policy
                    
                      
                        With the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence, the utilization of large language models becomes more flexible and effective, enabling multitasking enhancement for peer feedback in collaboration with human's professional knowledge.
                      
                      
                        Multimodal data analysis effectively collaborates with human observations by managing low‐level observation aspects, allowing humans to concentrate on higher‐level thinking guided by the educational interpretations.
                      
                      
                        The effectiveness of the HIF system is influenced by teachers' pedagogical knowledge, prior feedback provision experience and data literacy. In the future research, these diversities need to be taken into account in the design of video‐based PD incorporating HIF to assess its long‐term efficacy.},

	abstract = {While much work in learning analytics focuses on understanding and supporting the individual learner, a great deal of learning activity happens in groups, offering opportunities to generate insight into joint learning practices. How learners interact with each other in support of learning has been a topic of rich theorization for some time, from early work on face-to-face cooperation to more recent attention focused on computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL). This chapter unpacks four different relationships between collaborative learning theory and learning analytics (Application, Testing/Refinement, Generation, and Implementation) by examining work related to theories of joint attention, online listening, and knowledge building. Considering the relationship between theory and analytics as mediated by elements of technology, pedagogy, epistemology, and data, the chapter offers guidance for selecting relevant collaborative learning theory for particular analytic uses and overviews central issues to be considered in such use (e.g. group versus individual units of analysis, leveraging constructs and/or process models, inclusion of temporality, appropriate audiences to interpret and act on analytic outputs).},

	abstract = {Despite the widespread implementation of learning analytics (LA)-based feedback systems, there exists a gap in empirical investigations regarding their influence on learning outcomes. Moreover, existing research primarily focuses on individual differences, such as self-regulation and motivation, overlooking the potential of feedback literacy (FL). FL, an emerging skill set, goes beyond comprehending feedback; it entails effectively applying feedback to enhance the learning experience. This study aims to investigate the impact of LA-based feedback on knowledge acquisition and transfer, specifically focusing on the role of FL. Ninety-five students participated in a quasi-experimental design with three feedback conditions: Process feedback with FL practice, Process feedback only, and Outcome feedback. The study utilized a learning environment with an LA dashboard and prompting features. Participants underwent pre-tests and post-tests evaluating their knowledge acquisition and transfer related to effective instructional methodologies for online teaching. The study shows that LA-based process feedback enhances knowledge transfer but not acquisition. Notably, FL moderates this impact, emphasizing its crucial role in maximizing LA-based feedback benefits. The study underscores the importance of prioritizing FL development in educational institutions. The study offers valuable insights into LA, FL, and learning outcomes, guiding informed and customized feedback practices in education.},

The paper describes how a targeted LA intervention was grounded within the ICAP theory for active learning to identify, visualise and analyse student engagement metrics in a 100\% online setting. The architecture of the model, including its design principles and underlying assumptions, are broadly examined against the latest research in educational, LA, and data analytics research. This includes a discussion of our initial phase testing results of captured student data alongside a discussion of key questions and desired study outcomes for the upcoming phase 2 of the data intervention. As a result, this paper provides both specific insights into how we created an evidence based and pedagogically sound evaluation model of online student engagement within a specific suite of asynchronous educational tools, as well as more general and practical insights into how other universities could develop similar approaches to enhance understanding and support of a growing online student population.},

Overall, we found that participants’ scores were medium-high (2.5–3.5 on a 5-point Likert scale), with scores being higher for women compared with men and positively correlated with experience with Moodle. An overarching theme arises from our analyses of instructors’ interests and intentions, which portrays their idea of teaching as somewhat traditional and instructor-centered; however, their declared actions make it clear that they are willing to make some desirable changes to the beneﬁts of students. Finally, we found that instructors’ perceptions of data use and data importance are positive predictors of taking action upon viewing student data.},

	abstract = {In collaborative learning, students may follow different trajectories that evolve over time. This study used a multilayered approach to map the temporal dynamics of online problembased learning (PBL) and the transition of students’ roles across time over a full year duration. Based on data from 135 dental students across four consecutive courses throughout a full academic year, the students’ discourses were coded based on the community of inquiry (CoI). A mixture model was used to identify students’ roles. The roles identified were leaders, social mediators, and peripheral explorer roles, and they were visualized using epistemic network analysis (ENA). Similar trajectories were identified and visualized using sequence and process mining. The results showed varying activity levels across three trajectories. Students in the active-constructive trajectory took on leadership roles, while the students in the social interactive trajectory were mostly social mediators, and the free rider trajectory showed a predominant peripheral explorer role. The students in all trajectories returned to their initial roles, showing features typical of stable collaborative dispositions. Both active trajectories (active constructive and social interactive) had very close levels of achievement, whereas the free riders demonstrated lower grades compared to their peers. This research suggests that understanding role dynamics and their evolving trajectories can help teachers better design future collaborative activities, assign roles, form groups, distribute tasks, and, more importantly, be able to support students.},

	abstract = {Research and development of Learning Analytics (LA) have created new ways to support students’ learning. However, our understand­ ing of teachers’ roles when implementing LA in classroom practices remains nascent. This study investigates how teachers can imple­ ment LA to support students’ agency in directing their own inquiry, when engaging in a digital pedagogy approach known as Knowledge Building (KB) on an online platform called Knowledge Forum (KF). Together with a teacher experienced in KB and KF, we co-constructed interventions anchored on two easy-to-use LA tools in KF, the Scaffold Tracker and Word Cloud. These LA interventions were enacted with a Grade 5 class of 18 students and another Grade 6 class of 18 students. Three teacher roles were identified: detecting behaviour unproductive to collaboration, mediating between LA and student self-assessment, and framing student-generated lines of inquiry in actionable ways. We coded KF notes for the discourse moves they reflected and found that after the teacher implemented the LA interventions, notes that sustained inquiry increased sharply with students’ focus shifting from individual to collective knowl­ edge and from superficial explanations to deep understandings. We discuss the implications of these findings on the development of ways to bridge LA research and practice.},

The present study looked at a group of university students (N = 149) engaged in peer editing of one another’s essays in an online security studies course. The analysis was conducted from two perspectives: feedback givers and feedback receivers. More specifically, the relationships between the giving of comments and tracking changes in peer’s work and writing score on essays were explored. The results showed that there was a positive correlation between the total number of received comments and the student’s writing score, whereas there was no correlation for the number of tracked changes (neither words deleted, nor words added). Surprisingly, students who assume that peers provide high quality tracked changes demonstrate worse writing performance. This research shows the importance of nuance in understanding peer editing types and their influence on students’ performance, as well as highlighting potential complexities of the interplay between students’ collaborative activities, their performance, and their attitudes.},

	abstract = {Multimodal learning analytics (MMLA) offers the potential to provide evidence‐based insights into complex learning phenomena such as collaborative learning. Yet, few MMLA applications have closed the learning analytics loop by being evaluated in real‐world educational settings. This study evaluates the effectiveness of an MMLA solution in enhancing feedback and reflection within a complex and highly dynamic collaborative learning environment. A two‐year longitudinal study was conducted with 399 students and 17 teachers, utilising an MMLA system in reflective debriefings in the context of healthcare education. We analysed the survey data of 74 students and 11 teachers regarding their perceptions of the MMLA system. We applied the Evaluation Framework for Learning Analytics, augmented by complexity, accuracy and trust measures, to assess both teachers' and students' perspectives. The findings illustrated that teachers and students both had generally positive perceptions of the MMLA solution. Teachers found the MMLA solution helpful in facilitating feedback provision and reflection during debriefing sessions. Similarly, students found the MMLA solution effective in providing clarity on the data collected, stimulating reflection on their learning behaviours, and prompting considerations for adaptation in their learning behaviours. However, the complexity of the MMLA solution and the need for qualitative measures of communication emerged as areas for improvement. Additionally, the study highlighted the importance of data accuracy, transparency, and privacy protection to maintain user trust. The findings provide valuable contributions to advancing our understanding of the use of MMLA in supporting feedback and reflection practices in intricate collaborative learning while identifying avenues for further research and improvement. We also provided several insights and practical recommendations for successful MMLA implementation in authentic learning contexts.

                        Multimodal learning analytics (MMLA) seeks to generate data‐informed insights about learners' metacognitive and emotional states as well as their learning behaviours, by utilising intricate physical and physiological signals.
                      
                      
                        MMLA has not only pioneered novel data analytic methods but also aspired to complete the learning analytics loop by crafting innovative, tangible solutions that relay these insights to the concerned stakeholders.
                      
                      
                        A prominent direction within MMLA research has been the formulation of tools to support feedback and reflection in collaborative learning scenarios, given MMLA's capacity to discern intricate and dynamic learning behaviours.

	abstract = {An in-depth analysis of collaborative problem solving (CPS) patterns contributes to understand team dynamics and effective paths to conflict resolution. However, there remains the lack of a perspective in the field of CPS research that organically combines the cognitive, meta-cognitive, and social-communicative dimensions. Moreover, the analysis of CPS sequences has primarily focused on the temporal dimension while overlooking the differences in spatial dimensions. To shed further light on the nature of CPS in computerbased environments, this study collected discourse data generated by 24 university students through an online synchronous chat tool. They were student teachers from a variety of disciplines (math, history, English, etc.) who were required to accomplish two tasks: instructional design and multimedia courseware development. Specifically, a three-stage analytical framework was proposed to code, cluster, and analyze these discourse data to further explore the differences in CPS patterns. We clustered time sequences by calculating the distance similarity metric via the dynamic time warping (DTW) method, which took into account both the spatial and temporal characteristics of the time sequences. Consequently, 16 time sequences of CPS processes were divided into 2 kinds of clusters (CPS subgroups), i.e., cluster 1 and cluster 2. From the statistical analysis, both clusters actively used the skills included in the meta-cognitive dimensions. Cluster 1 was oriented toward the solution of the problem whereas cluster 2 focused primarily on the requirements of the collaborative problem itself. From the process mining analysis, solution-driven cluster 1 tended to focus on expressing specific ideas and evaluating and summarizing them, intermittently monitoring and regulating task progress. Problem-driven cluster 2 tended to express specific ideas intermittently, and lacked the process of summarizing and evaluating different ideas to further filter out the best solutions. Finally, we summarized the implications of this study from theoretical and practical perspectives and discussed future research directions with regard to the limitations of this study.},

In this chapter, readers will become familiar with sequence analysis techniques and tools through real-life step-by-step examples of sequential trace log data of students’ online activities. Readers will be guided on how to visualize the common sequence plots and interpret such visualizations. An essential part of sequence analysis is the discovery of patterns within sequences through clustering techniques.

            Modeling a longitudinal process in educational research brings a lot of variability over time. The modeling procedure becomes even harder when using multivariate continuous variables, e.g., clicks on learning resources, time spent online, and interactions with peers. In fact, most human behavioral constructs are an amalgam of interrelated features with complex fluctuations over time. Modeling such processes requires a method that takes into account the multidimensional nature of the examined construct as well as the temporal evolution. In this chapter we describe the VaSSTra method, which combines person-based methods, sequence analysis and life-events methods. Throughout the chapter, we discuss how to derive states from different variables related to students, how to construct sequences from students’ longitudinal progression of states, and how to identify and study distinct trajectories of sequences that undergo a similar evolution. We also cover some advanced properties of sequences that can help us analyze and compare trajectories. We illustrate the method through a tutorial using the R programming language.},

Throughout this chapter, we describe multi-channel sequence analysis in detail, with an emphasis on how to detect patterns within the sequences, i.e., clusters —or trajectories— of multi-channel sequences that share similar temporal evolutions (or similar trajectories). To illustrate this method we present a step-by-step tutorial in R that analyses students’ sequences of online engagement and academic achievement, exploring their longitudinal association. We cover two approaches for clustering multi-channel sequences: one based on using distance-based algorithms, and the other employing mixture hidden Markov models inspired by recent research.},

	abstract = {The recent advances in educational technology enabled the development of solutions that collect and analyse data from learning scenarios to inform the decision-making processes. Research fields like Learning Analytics (LA) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) aim at supporting teaching and learning by using such solutions. However, their adoption in authentic settings is still limited, among other reasons, derived from ignoring the stakeholders’ needs, a lack of pedagogical contextualisation, and a low trust in new technologies. Thus, the research fields of Human-Centered LA (HCLA) and Human-Centered AI (HCAI) recently emerged, aiming to understand the active involvement of stakeholders in the creation of such proposals. This paper presents a systematic literature review of 47 empirical research studies on the topic. The results show that more than two-thirds of the papers involve stakeholders in the design of the solutions, while fewer papers involved them during the ideation and prototyping, and the majority do not report any evaluation. Interestingly, while multiple techniques were used to collect data (mainly interviews, focus groups and workshops), few papers explicitly mentioned the adoption of existing HC design guidelines. Further evidence is needed to show the real impact of HCLA/HCAI approaches (e.g., in terms of user satisfaction and adoption).},

Concurrently, it has been shown that high-information feedback has the largest effect sizes for learning outcomes and academic performance. The following chapter provides insights to an approach to provide formative feedback supported by artificial intelligence in distance learning, that does not analyze summative assessment data, but rather intends to guide students in their learning process towards the graded final assessment. Approaches that are using methods of artificial intelligence and learning analytics have in common that they need data to derivate senseful outcomes. But how can students’ behavior in online learning courses be measured, and which concrete clickstream entries can be used to calculate these measures? This contribution looks at indicators focusing on data for supporting metacognitive learning strategies and illustrates especially the process to extract measures of behavioral engagement from raw log data and its conversion into high-information feedback. The entire process is reflected in collaboration with lecturers to design a didactically guided, user-­ centered interface that supports student reflections towards improving their learning and assessment preparation. The pursued solution includes a dashboard in combination with a rule-based personalized feedback text, connecting engagement measures with additional information (e.g., learning material, techniques, etc.).

	abstract = {Learning analytics is a rapidly growing field in higher education, comprising collecting and analysing data to improve teaching and learning practices. The potency of learning analytics rests on both understanding relational dynamics and demonstrating their generalisability and temporal stability—aspects often underexplored in the literature. Recognising the benefits of formative assessments with corresponding feedback in promoting short- and long-term learning outcomes, we implemented several course-specific online formative assessments in four different courses at the University of Bern, Switzerland. Through these assessments, we gathered data from various domains, including task-specific information, students’ learning behaviour, and their prior knowledge. Our analysis demonstrated substantial relationships between initial, formative, and summative assessments, alongside variables like attitude and effort, which were consistent across the different courses. Given the identified relationships and their consistency, learning analytics has the potential to significantly enhance the quality of tertiary education. Further, these findings emphasise the critical importance of leveraging learning analytics in educational institutions.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a Human-Centred Learning Analytics (HCLA) design approach for developing learning analytics (LA) dashboards for K-12 classrooms that maintain both contextual relevance and scalability—two goals that are often in competition. Using mixed methods, we collected observational and interview data from teacher partners and assessment data from their students' engagement with the lesson materials. This DBR-based, human-centred design process resulted in a dashboard that supported teachers in addressing their students' learning needs. To develop the dashboard features that could support teachers, we found that a design refinement process that drew on the insights of teachers with varying teaching experience, philosophies and teaching contexts strengthened the resulting outcome. The versatile nature of the approach, in terms of student learning outcomes, makes it useful for HCLA design efforts across diverse K-12 educational contexts. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Learning analytics that are aligned to both a learning theory and learning design support student learning. LA dashboards that support users to understand the associated learning analytics data provide actionable insight. Design-based research is a promising methodology for Human-Centred Learning Analytics design, particularly in the K-12 educational context. What this paper adds Leveraging a longstanding, yet fluid, research-practice partnership is an effective design-based research adaptation for addressing the high variation in instructional practices that characterize K-12 education. Using both quantitative and qualitative data that reflects students' developing knowledge effectively supports teachers' inquiry into student learning. Teachers' use of learning analytics dashboards is heavily influenced by their perspectives on teaching and learning. Implications for practice and/or policy Impact on student learning outcomes, alongside usability and feasibility, should be included as a necessary metric for the effectiveness of LA design. LA dashboard developers should both leverage learning data that reflect students' developing knowledge and position teachers to take responsive pedagogical action to support student learning. LA researchers and developers should utilize a long-term, yet fluid, research-practice partnership to form a multi-stakeholder, multidisciplinary design team for Human-Centred Learning Analytics design.},

	abstract = {The paper argues that learning analytics as a research field can benefit from a theory-informed shared language to describe sensemaking of learning and teaching data. To make the case for such shared language, first, I critically review prominent sensemaking theories to then demonstrate how studies in learning analytics do not use coherent descriptions of sensemaking, eclectically combining the paradigms that have underlying differences. I then propose a conceptualization of sensemaking that overcomes the differences between these theories and explains how the concepts of activity system, the definition of the situation and affordances can be used to capture individual differences in sensemaking. The paper concludes with a preliminary framework and examples demonstrating its utility in raising new theoretical questions, informing design principles and providing shared language for researchers in learning analytics.Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Sensemaking happens when individuals try to explain unknown situations. Learning analytics uses sensemaking as a lens to understand dashboard use. Systematic analysis of sensemaking is essential for learning analytics. What this paper adds The paper notes that noticing and perceiving are commonly examined in learning analytics on dashboard use. The paper suggests a revision of fundamental assumptions in sensemaking. A paper proposes a toy model of sensemaking that includes operationalization of the definition of the situation, activity where sensemaking happens and processes of noticing and perceiving affordances. Implications for practice and/or policy Learning analytics must examine sensemaking of data about teaching and learning in a systematic manner. Internal perceptions of the social environment and activity that are informed by the data need to be considered in evaluating dashboard use.},

In this study, we investigate the impact of counselling instances supported by a learning analytics (LA) tool, called TrAC, which provides specific data about the curriculum and grades of each student. To evaluate the tool, we measured changes in students' performance ranking position over 3 years and compared the performance of students who received counselling with and without the tool. Our results show that using the tool is related to an improvement in cohort ranking. We further investigated the characteristics of counselled students using cluster analyses. The findings highlight the potential beneficial influence on academic outcomes arising from the provision of guidance to students regarding their course load decisions via TrAC-­mediated counselling. This study contributes to the field of LA by providing evidence of the impact of counselling supported by an LA tool in a real-­world setting over a long period of time.

This systematic review provides an overview of the current state of online peer feedback implementation in higher education contexts and explores the role of students’ characteristics and online learning environments in relation to their learning processes and outcomes. To achieve this goal, the PRISMA method was followed, and a coding scheme was developed to create a framework that can guide the implementation of online peer feedback in higher education settings. This framework depicts factors that should be taken into account for effective implementation of online peer feedback in terms of four dimensions: students’ characteristics (demographic characteristics, academic background, and personality and psychological features), environmental conditions (learning platform and setting), learning processes (content, feedback activity design, and technology), and learning outcomes including cognitive outcomes (e.g., acquisition of knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation), behavioral outcomes (engagement, communication, and teamwork), and affective outcomes (satisfaction, motivation, attitude, self-efficacy, sense of autonomy, and confidence).

	title = {Contact teaching versus 3d collaborative online virtual learning: an engineering student perspective},
	abstract = {A collaborative virtual learning environment (CVLE) is generally understood as a digital shared multiuser world where students can join and move freely. Such a system provides an ideal setting for peer-assisted learning, since it mimics key affordances found in a regular classroom setting whilst lacking many of the constraints. While many studies explore the feasibility, non-functional attributes and learning impact of CVLEs, there is little empirical work dedicated to 3D collaborative learning environments. Given the current metaverse hype, tools and online services for CVLE implementation are bound to become more commonplace. Thereby, prompting educators to leverage the advantages of such teaching interfaces. This paper intends to set the tone for CVLE best practices and learning expectations by striking a direct comparison, both quantitatively and qualitatively, between face-to-face lecturing and a 3D CVLE. A group of 52 students attended four Games and Interactive Technologies Engineering lectures on gamification and serious games before spending three weeks with a 3D CVLE that comprises the same learning material. We quantitatively compared the two teaching modalities on: (a) effectiveness by means the cognitive, affective, and psychomotor (CAP) perceived learning questionnaire; and (b) student preference through a comparative Likert scale course satisfaction survey. Our quantitative results showed no significant difference in perceived learning between the two modalities and an overall lower satisfaction for the 3D CVLE mode. During the qualitative feedback sessions, we collected the reasons for the lower satisfaction scores and were able to conclude that educators who wish to pursue 3D CVLEs should ensure that: (a) their environment has a high usability rating, with minimal bugs; (b) any tasks they wish to incorporate for learning are interactive and contextual to the learning material; (c) customizable features, especially avatars, are present; and (d) the reward mechanic is not a mere accrual of engagement evidence, but impacts gameplay directly.},

This two-­group longitudinal study investigated the development of such transfer of learning in a histology course. After 0, 10, and 20 sessions of the 10-­week-l­ong course, medical students completed theoretical tasks, examined histological slides trained in the course (retention task), and unfamiliar histological slides (transfer task). The results showed that students in the histology group gradually outperformed the control group in all tasks, especially in the second half of the course, η2 = 0.268 (p {\textless} 0.001). The best predictor of final transfer performance was students’ retention performance after 10 sessions, β = 0.32 (p = 0.028), and theoretical knowledge after 20 sessions, β = 0.46 (p = 0.003). Results of eye tracking methodology further revealed that the histology group engaged in greater “visual activity” when solving transfer tasks, as indicated by an increase in the total fixation count, η2 = 0.103 (p = 0.014). This longitudinal study provides evidence that medical students can use what they learn in histology courses to solve unfamiliar problems but cautions that positive transfer effects develop relatively late in the course. Thus, course time and the complex relationship between theory, retention, and transfer holds critical implications for anatomical curricula seeking to foster the transfer of learning.},

	abstract = {Background  Effective teaching methods are needed to improve students’ abilities in hand-eye coordination and understanding of cardiac anatomy in echocardiography education. Simulation devices have emerged as innovative teaching tools and exhibited distinctive advantages due to their ability to provide vivid and visual learning experiences. This study aimed to investigate the effect of simulation of sectional human anatomy using ultrasound on students’ learning outcomes and satisfaction in echocardiography education. Methods  The study included 18 first-year clinical medical students with no prior echocardiography training. After randomization, they underwent a pre-test to assess basic knowledge. Following this, the students were divided into two groups: traditional teaching (traditional group) and simulation of sectional human anatomy using ultrasound (digital group). Each group received 60 min of instruction. Post-tests were assigned to students at two different time points: immediately after the lecture, and one week later (referred to as post-tests 1, and 2). In addition, anonymous questionnaires were distributed to students after class to investigate their satisfaction with teaching. Results  Both groups showed significant improvement in their scores on post-test 1 compared to pre-test (traditional group: from 33.1 ± 8.8 to 48.1 ± 13.1, P = 0.034 vs. digital group: from 35.0 ± 6.7 to 58.0 ± 13.2, P = 0.008). However, there were no significant differences between the two groups in several post-test comparisons. Student satisfaction ratings revealed that the digital group experienced significantly greater satisfaction in areas such as subject interest, teaching style, course alignment, and interaction compared to the traditional group. Additionally, 80\% of the digital group strongly endorsed the use of simulation of sectional human anatomy using ultrasound for echocardiography teaching, highlighting its effectiveness.},

	abstract = {Maker culture emphasizes informal, networked, self- and peer-led learning, motivated by fun and self-fulfillment, and learning through mistakes. However, studies often describe activities involving a lot of guidance. As guidance may lead to both the process and outcomes influenced by those guiding the activity, it is also important to examine how projects evolve without the supporters' push. We take a nexus analytical approach to explore 1) how teens' background, interactions with others, and available materials and spaces are at play when they shape their ideas and outputs in a collaborative maker project with minimal support, and 2) how these factors can be considered to better support learning in such projects. The work carried out by five teens in a local FabLab was based on peer collaboration within changing apprentice mentor pairs. When they ideated and prototyped for a future school, researchers provided minimal support, mainly online. Without their push, teens quickly modified tasks which both guided and narrowed down their thinking. Their experiences from school environment and the FabLab space served as an inspiration as they designed solutions to overcome current problems in the current school setting or digital fabrication process. When making, they gravitated towards processes they had previous experience of or which they enjoyed, perhaps partly affected by the competing discourses of maker culture and expertise we observed to be present in the FabLab space. While building on existing skillsets, this may leave the potential of novel trajectories and expanding one's skills and competences unexplored. Teens' self-esteem improved as they turned from apprentices to mentors for their peers. This allowed them to process their learning from a different perspective. In general, our results paint a detailed picture of the roles of different participants in a maker project and provide an example of how familiar discourses of education persist in teens' designs. Looking at the project through the lens of Nexus analysis contributes to an increased understanding of the space for action and participants' histories, and interactions on the process, valuable for researchers studying DF and making, and practitioners working in makerspaces and FabLabs with different user groups. On a more practical level, our work contributes to a deeper understanding on how to include teens into non-guided and community-driven maker practices. We provide practical implications on how to support learning in collaborative making projects in informal learning situations, and regarding the role of the different actors and the environment in such situations. We also identify avenues for future research in this area.},

	abstract = {In educational assessment, behavioral engagement refers to the extent to which learners actively participate in the assessment process and are motivated to perform well. Behavioral engagement plays a crucial role in the design, use, and interpretation of educational assessments because learners who are engaged in the assessment process are likely to perform better and retain the information being assessed than those who fail to make enough effort when responding to test items. To date, researchers have identified various indicators of behavioral engagement in digital assessments, such as spending sufficient time on each item or task, attempting to answer all questions, and interacting with the assessment environment. Assessment analytics can enable researchers to use these indicators to track, analyze, and interpret learners’ behavioral engagement in digital assessments. This chapter discusses the role of behavioral engagement in digital assessments, including computer-based tests and intelligent tutoring systems. We examine research on behavioral engagement and explain how it can be utilized in assessment analytics. As we describe state-of-the-art methods for modeling and interpreting behavioral engagement, we also present real-life case studies to illustrate these methods.},

	abstract = {Ressourcenorientierte Erziehung, die Kindern und Jugendliche nach einem berühmten Aphorismus ‚Wurzeln und Flügel‘ verleiht, nimmt statt der Defizite die Ressourcen in den Blick, um Kinder und Jugendliche zu stärken und in ihrer Entwicklung zu fördern. Potential- und Ressourcenorientierung in der Schule benötigen eine inklusive Didaktik, die die Individualität aller Schülerinnen und Schüler akzeptiert, adaptiven und binnendifferenzierten Unterricht realisiert und Gemeinsamkeiten durch Kollaboration und Kooperation herstellt. Wie dem Anspruch auf Persönlichkeitsbildung fachdidaktisch begegnet werden kann, soll in diesem Beitrag anhand eines Beispiels einer Projektarbeit im Kunstunterricht der Sekundarstufe 1 nachgegangen werden. Im Mittelpunkt des Projekts „Roots and Wings – Kinder finden in sich eine grenzenlose Welt und schaffen sich ihr eigenes Paradies“ stand folgende Aufgabe: „Stelle Dir vor, dass das Leben auf der Erde ein Paradies ist. Wie lebst du dann? Wie sieht dein Umfeld aus? Was gibt dir Sicherheit? Was inspiriert dich?“ Mit ihr setzten sich die Jugendlichen zuerst zeichnerisch in Einzelarbeit auseinander und bauten kollaborativ 3D-Szenerien aus Abfallmaterial, in denen sie Stop-Motion-Animationen1 entwickelten. Die qualitativ-inhaltsanalytische Auswertung der kurzen Videostatements der Kollektive ergab, dass sich die Schülerinnen und Schüler ihrer Lernfortschritte und der Entfaltung individueller Potentiale bewusst waren. Kunstunterricht kann durch eigenständige Projektarbeit im Kollektiv wichtige Ressourcen bereitstellen, die für die Identitäts- und Persönlichkeitsentwicklung grundlegend sind. (DIPF/Orig.)},

After taking a 12-week course to improve entrepreneurial ability among students (in particular, paying attention to the motivational component of the study), one can note significant shifts in the internal positive motivation of experimental group students after taking this course. Thus, their percentage component increased to 43\% compared to 25\% initially (p = 0.3585). Simultaneously, substantial structural changes were observed in the analysis of students’ entrepreneurial abilities, demonstrating improvements across nearly all assessment items. Future research directions should include studying the integration of MOOCs into academic programs and their impact not only on motivation, but also on success and long-term programs examining the impact of MOOC implementation on the post-graduation success of university students.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Digital health is described as the use and development of all types of digital technologies to improve health outcomes. It could be used to prevent medication errors, a priority for health systems worldwide. However, the adoption of such tools remains slow. This study aims to identify factors (attitudes, knowledge and beliefs) acting as barriers and/or facilitators reported by healthcare professionals (HCPs) for the adoption of digital health-related tools for medication appropriateness.
METHODS: A systematic review was performed by searching the literature in the MEDLINE PubMed, and EMBASE scientific databases for original articles regarding qualitative and quantitative data.
RESULTS: Fifteen articles were included and a total of 125 barriers and 108 facilitators were identified, consolidated and categorized into technical (n = 48), organizational (n = 12), economical (n = 4), user-related (n = 34), and patient-related (n = 8) components. The most often reported barriers and facilitators were technical component-related ones concerning the need for additional training (n = 6), the time consumed (n = 6), and the easy way of using or learning how to use the tools (n = 9), respectively. Regarding setting analysis, agreement with clinical decision recommendations and impact on the doctor-patient relationship were more valued in primary care, while the user interface and system design were in the hospital.
CONCLUSIONS: The barriers and facilitators identified in this study provide relevant information to developers and it can be used as a starting point for the designing of successful digital health-related tools, specifically related to medication appropriateness. Future research includes economic evaluation-focused studies and in-depth case studies of specific barriers and facilitators.},

	doi = {10.3389/fsurg.2024.1287218},
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Head-mounted displays (HMDs) that superimpose holograms onto patients are of particular surgical interest as they are believed to dramatically change surgical procedures by including safety warning and allowing real-time offsite consultations. Although there are promising benefits of mixed and augmented reality (MR/AR) technologies in surgery, they also raise new ethical concerns. The aim of this systematic review is to determine the full spectrum of ethical issues that is raised for surgeons in the intraoperative application of MR/AR technology.
METHODS: Five bibliographic databases were searched for publications on the use of MR/AR, HMDs and other devices, their intraoperative application in surgery, and ethical issues. We applied qualitative content analysis to the n = 50 articles included. Firstly, we coded the material with deductive categories derived from ethical frameworks for surgical innovations, complications and research. Secondly, clinical aspects with ethical relevance were inductively coded as ethical issues within the main categories. Thirdly, we pooled the ethical issues into themes and sub-themes. We report our findings according to the reporting guideline RESERVE.
RESULTS: We found n = 143 ethical issues across ten main themes, namely patient-physician relationship, informed consent, professionalism, research and innovation, legal and regulatory issues, functioning equipment and optimal operating conditions, allocation of resources, minimizing harm, good communication skills and the ability to exercise sound judgement. The five most prevalent ethical issues are "Need for continuous research and innovation", "Ensuring improvement of the learning curve", "MR/AR enables new maneuvers for surgeons", "Ensuring improvement of comfort, ergonomics, and usability of devices," and "Not withholding MR/AR if it performs better".
CONCLUSIONS: Recognizing the evidence-based limitations of the intraoperative MR/AR application is of paramount importance to avoid ethical issues, but clinical trials in surgery pose particular ethical risks for patients. Regarding the digital surgeon, long-term impact on human workforce, potentially harmful "negative training," i.e., acquiring inappropriate behaviors, and the fear of surveillance need further attention. MR/AR technologies offer not only challenges but significant advantages, promoting a more equitable distribution of surgical expertise and optimizing healthcare. Aligned with the core principle of social justice, these technologies enable surgeons to collaborate globally, improving training conditions and addressing enduring global healthcare inequalities.},

	doi = {10.1186/s13000-024-01464-7},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The integration of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT in diagnostic medicine, with a focus on digital pathology, has garnered significant attention. However, understanding the challenges and barriers associated with the use of LLMs in this context is crucial for their successful implementation.
METHODS: A scoping review was conducted to explore the challenges and barriers of using LLMs, in diagnostic medicine with a focus on digital pathology. A comprehensive search was conducted using electronic databases, including PubMed and Google Scholar, for relevant articles published within the past four years. The selected articles were critically analyzed to identify and summarize the challenges and barriers reported in the literature.
RESULTS: The scoping review identified several challenges and barriers associated with the use of LLMs in diagnostic medicine. These included limitations in contextual understanding and interpretability, biases in training data, ethical considerations, impact on healthcare professionals, and regulatory concerns. Contextual understanding and interpretability challenges arise due to the lack of true understanding of medical concepts and lack of these models being explicitly trained on medical records selected by trained professionals, and the black-box nature of LLMs. Biases in training data pose a risk of perpetuating disparities and inaccuracies in diagnoses. Ethical considerations include patient privacy, data security, and responsible AI use. The integration of LLMs may impact healthcare professionals' autonomy and decision-making abilities. Regulatory concerns surround the need for guidelines and frameworks to ensure safe and ethical implementation.
CONCLUSION: The scoping review highlights the challenges and barriers of using LLMs in diagnostic medicine with a focus on digital pathology. Understanding these challenges is essential for addressing the limitations and developing strategies to overcome barriers. It is critical for health professionals to be involved in the selection of data and fine tuning of the models. Further research, validation, and collaboration between AI developers, healthcare professionals, and regulatory bodies are necessary to ensure the responsible and effective integration of LLMs in diagnostic medicine.},

	abstract = {Digital games (DGs) have the potential to immerse learners in simulated real-world environments that foster contextualised and active learning experiences. These also offer opportunities for performance assessments by providing an environment for students to carry out tasks requiring the application of knowledge and skills learned in the classroom. Although widely used for teaching and learning, there are challenges in using digital game applications for assessment. Designing assessments around tasks in complex learning environments like DGs is not always easy, particularly for educators new to using these technologies for teaching. This paper presents a game-based assessment framework (GBAF) that is designed to be educator-friendly and useful for the design of assessments for immersive learning environments. The application of the framework to the design of embedded and external (multiple-choice questions) assessments is also presented. The GBAF offered an easy and structured basis for the design of two distinct assessments for a computer game. It provides educators with useful guidelines for designing assessments around pre-existing games. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Immersive technologies are increasingly being used for teaching and learning due to their benefits to knowledge and skills acquisition. However, for educators interested in using these tools for formal classroom teaching, there is a lack of resources and guidance on assessment designs and implementations. The most commonly used assessment design framework, the evidence-centred design (ECD), is complicated to use, requiring advanced machine learning skills to implement. This has so far limited its use to large-scale computerised and game-based testing. What this paper adds This paper presents a framework developed to guide educators through the design and implementation of assessments when teaching with immersive learning applications. Grounded in the constructive alignment principles and the ECD framework, the game-based assessment framework is designed to help educators align assessment tasks to game tasks and the intended learning outcomes. It also provides step-by-step guidelines for the identification of appropriate immersive applications. It shows the practical application of the framework to the design of embedded (in-game) assessments and external (multiple-choice tests) assessments. Implications for practice and/or policy The framework presented in this paper provides a structured and pedagogically sound basis for the design of assessments when measuring performance, or skills and knowledge acquisition with immersive learning applications.},

However, few studies have focused on the effects of information feedback on self-efficacy, SRL strategies, and perceived and actual learning effectiveness. Social cognitive and SRL theories describe the learning process of monitoring, controlling, and evaluating individual behavior and the corresponding environment. Insufficient information feedback hinders learning using GBLS and results in weak perceived and actual learning effectiveness. Some researchers have investigated the information feedback intervention mechanism and its significance. The partial least square method was used to investigate a convenience sample of 240 undergraduate students to test the proposed hypotheses. The research results indicated that information feedback significantly affects self-efficacy, SRL strategy, and perceived and actual learning effectiveness. Surprisingly, the SRL strategy does not significantly affect actual learning effectiveness. The theoretical and practical implications of this study are discussed.},

	abstract = {Despite the growing importance of MOOCs and their application in face-to-face classes since 2020, driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, existing literature offers limited research on the factors affecting the quality of hybrid MOOC (hMOOC) learning, particularly from a psychological perspective. Thus, based on the 3P model of teaching and learning, this study aims to build a psychological pathway to empirically investigate the indicators of, and their relationship with, hMOOC learning outcomes by examining task value belief and relational quality as presage variables, and learner engagement and knowledge sharing as process variables, leading to learner satisfaction as the product. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to 750 undergraduate learners with prior experience in hMOOC learning in higher educational institutions of the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), path, and mediation analyses were conducted based on structural equation modeling (SEM). The results confirmed the hypothesis that task value belief and relational quality both significantly influenced learner satisfaction in hMOOCs. Task value belief exerted indirect effects on satisfaction through learner engagement. However, it failed to predict satisfaction through knowledge sharing indirectly. Instead, task value belief affected learner engagement first and then knowledge sharing, which finally impacted satisfaction, revealing the linear relationship of TVB→LE→KS→SA. Moreover, relational quality had an indirect effect on satisfaction through both learner engagement and knowledge sharing, indicating the interrelationships of RQ→LE \& KS→SA. Theoretical and pedagogical implications are discussed in the conclusion.},

High drop-out has been identified as one of the major problems with existing MOOC formats. Our work addresses two factors relating to non-completion. Firstly, MOOCs require a high degree of self-regulated learning (SRL) skills but most do not adequately develop such skills, thus making them inaccessible in practice to many. Related to this is the inflexibility and passivity of many current MOOC formats, preventing individuals from setting their own learning objectives and directing their own learning. This paper presents preliminary findings from an investigation into MOOC learners’ SRL skills and the relationship to how participants learn. Following a design science methodology, we have developed a novel MOOC platform to support learner choice and to assist participants in defining learning goals and developing individual study paths. This paper describes the architecture of the system and presents findings from a pilot MOOC developed on the platform. Our results indicate that there is a high demand for more flexible, self-directed learning but that MOOC learners exhibit deficiencies in specific SRL skills including help seeking and task strategies. The contextualised nature of SRL skills means that even learners with a strong background of formal education may not deploy the best strategies for MOOC learning. This work is of significance to MOOC development in general as it highlights the need for targeted strategies to encourage SRL in MOOC platforms and innovation.},

	abstract = {The objective of this research is to have a constructive influence on the development of online courses, consequently raising their enrollment, acceptance, and completion rates. Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs) are designed to make education accessible to all students on a global scale. MOOC platforms have rapidly grown in recent years as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and even the online learning trend. However, due to variables including course quality, internet connectivity, and lack of exposure, MOOCs' reach has been constrained. Students who sign up for MOOC courses frequently drop out owing to variety of reasons, such as a lack of interest or inadequate learning. The effectiveness of MOOCs among students has been the focus of numerous research. These research help MOOCs develop and expand. Student feedback is a well-liked metric for assessing a MOOC's efficacy. The Learning-Transfer-Result (LTR) technique is suggested in this research as a way to assess the efficiency of MOOCs in higher education. This technique was developed using Student feedback, who registered in various online courses, were asked to provide input under the headings of learning, transfer, and results. The replies were then examined. The findings of this study offer guidance to organizations who intend to produce online content in the future and to improve student retention rates through course customization.},

	abstract = {The use of deep learning algorithms to extract meaningful diagnostic features from biomedical images holds the promise to improve patient care given the expansion of digital pathology. Among these deep learning models, Vision Transformer (ViT) models have been demonstrated to capture long-range spatial relationships with more robust prediction power for image classification tasks than regular convolutional neural network (CNN) models, and also better model interpretability. Model interpretation is important for understanding and elucidating how a deep learning model makes predictions, especially for developing transparent models for digital pathology. However, like other deep learning algorithms, with limited annotated biomedical imaging datasets, ViT models are prone to poor performance due to overfitting, which can lead to false predictions due to random noise. Overfitting affects model interpretation when predictions are made out of random noise. To address this issue, we introduce a novel metric - Training Attention and Validation Attention Consistency (TAVAC) - for evaluating ViT model degree of overfitting on imaging datasets and quantifying the reproducibility of interpretation. Specifically, the model interpretation is performed by comparing the high-attention regions in the image between training and testing. We test the method on four publicly available image classification datasets and two independent breast cancer histological image datasets. All overfitted models exhibited significantly lower TAVAC scores than the good-fit models. The TAVAC score quantitatively measures the level of generalization of model interpretation on a fine-grained level for small groups of cells in each H\&E image, which cannot be provided by traditional performance evaluation metrics like prediction accuracy. Furthermore, the application of TAVAC extends beyond medical diagnostic AI models; it enhances the monitoring of model interpretative reproducibility at pixel-resolution in basic research, to reveal critical spatial patterns and cellular structures essential to understanding biological processes and disease mechanisms. TAVAC sets a new standard for evaluating the performance of deep learning model interpretation and provides a method for determining the significance of high-attention regions detected from the attention map of the biomedical images.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing technologies have fuelled the growth of Pedagogical Conversational Agents (PCAs) with empathic conversational capabilities. However, no systematic literature review has explored the intersection between conversational agents, education and emotion. Therefore, this study aimed to outline the key aspects of designing, implementing and evaluating these agents. The data sources were empirical studies, including peer-reviewed conference papers and journal articles, and the most recent publications, from the ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, ProQuest, ScienceDirect, Scopus, SpringerLink, Taylor \& Francis Online, Web of Science and Wiley Online Library. The remaining papers underwent a rigorous quality assessment. A filter study meeting the objective was based on keywords. Comparative analysis and synthesis of results were used to handle data and combine study outcomes. Out of 1162 search results, 13 studies were selected. The results indicate that agents promote dialogic learning, proficiency in knowledge domains, personalized feedback and empathic abilities as essential design principles. Most implementations employ a quantitative approach, and two variables are used for evaluation. Feedback types play a vital role in achieving positive results in learning performance and student perceptions. The main limitations and gaps are the time range for literature selection, the level of integration of the empathic field and the lack of a detailed development stage report. Moreover, future directions are the ethical implications of agents operating beyond scheduled learning times and the adoption of Responsible AI principles. In conclusion, this review provides a comprehensive framework of empathic PCAs, mostly in their evaluation. The systematic review registration number is osf.io/3xk6a.Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Emotions play a pivotal role in shaping the interaction process, making it essential to consider them when designing methodological strategies or learning tools. Empathic Pedagogical Conversational Agents (PCAs) have emerged as a crucial approach for enhancing and personalizing the learning experience (24/7) for pupils and supporting human teachers in their teaching process. Despite the creation of numerous empathic PCAs, there is a scarcity of Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) on their application in the educational field, particularly concerning the integration of emotional abilities in combination with the competencies of each subject. What this paper adds It offers new insights into the design principles underlying the integration of the empathic field. It reviews different approaches for incorporating students' prior knowledge in real time. It provides a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the research designs used for implementation, including quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods. It examines the factors that influence the effectiveness of empathic PCA in teaching and learning. It evaluates the types of feedback that enhance the impact of the empathic field on learning outcomes. Implications for practice and/or policy It is crucial to grasp the topics that this paper introduces in order to effectively integrate new learning tools into any context. Techno-pedagogical designers seeking to gain insights into empathic PCAs will find immense value in this SLR, as it comprehensively covers each stage of the process. For future research endeavours, this study offers a wealth of ideas to draw upon, enabling researchers to address the challenges outlined and explore new avenues of investigation.},

	abstract = {In this quasi-experimental ﬁeld study, we investigated the effects of a digital support tool on knowledge about, assessment of, and feedback on self-regulated learning (SRL). Student teachers (N = 119) took the roles of learners and teachers. As learners, they wrote learning journals and received feedback on the strategies they had used. As teachers, they assessed a peer’s learning strategies elicited in the learning journals and provided feedback. A digital tool supported the participants in their role as teachers by providing additional assessment support (yes/no) and feedback support (yes/no). Assessment support was realized with rubrics, feedback support was realized with sentence starters. Our results indicated that declarative and self-reported knowledge about SRL increased in all groups. Assessment support did not foster assessment skills, but feedback support fostered the quality of the peer feedback and feedback quality in a standardized posttest. High feedback quality, in turn, predicted learners’ application of organizational (but not metacognitive) strategies. We conclude that the combination of writing learning journals and providing peer feedback on SRL is a promising approach to promote future teachers’ SRL skills. Digital tools can support writing the feedback, for example, by providing sentence starters as procedural facilitators. Such support can help teachers supply high-quality feedback on SRL, which can then help learners improve their SRL.},

Ausgangssituation und Problemstellung
Kfz-Mechatroniker*innen müssen zunehmend komplexe elektrische und elektronische Systeme diagnostizieren. Die Forschung zeigt, dass viele Auszubildende am Ende ihrer Ausbildung nicht ausreichend auf die Fehlerdiagnose vorbereitet sind.
Untersuchungsmethode
Entwicklung zweier digitaler Interventionsmaßnahmen ("basal" und "komplex") zur Förderung der Fehlerdiagnosekompetenz.
Durchführung einer experimentellen Studie mit Vor- und Nachtests zur Evaluierung der Effekte dieser Interventionsmaßnahmen im Vergleich zu einer Kontrollgruppe.
Wichtige Ergebnisse
Beide Interventionen führten zu einer signifikanten Verbesserung der Fehlerdiagnosekompetenz, wobei die "komplexe" Intervention besonders wirksam bei der Förderung komplexer diagnostischer Fähigkeiten war.
Die digitale Lernumgebung unterstützte effektiv das Erlernen und Üben von diagnoserelevanten Fähigkeiten und die Nutzung digitaler Diagnosesysteme.
Schlussfolgerungen
Digitale Lernumgebungen können eine effektive Methode sein, um spezifische berufliche Kompetenzen zu fördern, insbesondere in Bereichen, in denen traditionelle Lehrmethoden an ihre Grenzen stoßen.
Die Studie unterstreicht die Notwendigkeit, Lernumgebungen so zu gestalten, dass sie auf unterschiedliche Leistungsniveaus der Lernenden eingehen und ihnen ermöglichen, spezifische diagnostische Fähigkeiten gezielt zu entwickeln.

A total of 77 effect sizes were yielded across different studies, and random-effect modeling was employed for analyzing the study-level heterogeneity and sub-group variability. Results demonstrate that digital reading had an overall significant effect (dimmediate = 1.45, p {\textless} .01; ddeleayed = 2.98, p {\textless} .01) on L2 vocabulary learning of between-subject studies. For withinsubject studies, digital reading was found to have an upper-medium (d = 1.39, p {\textless} .01) and medium (d = .86, p {\textless} .01) effect on immediate and delayed L2 vocabulary post-tests. Moderating factor analysis results show that L2 proficiency, vocabulary test formats, and digital resources could robustly explain the variance of effect sizes. The findings have strong pedagogical implications on the effective design for digital reading tasks, including the development of adaptive learning algorithms and personalized lexical glosses. Recommendations for future research in the field are provided by pinpointing where to improve in terms of experimental design and the focus of the learner group.},

	abstract = {Objective: Training in video consultations is seldom included in the curriculum for future physicians. Exploration of preferred teaching methods and learning objectives in this context among medical students remains limited. This study addresses this research gap by conducting a survey among medical students in Germany to assess their educational requirements concerning video consultations and patient-centred distance learning.
Methods: This quantitative study employed an online questionnaire designed for German medical students, following the guidelines of the International Association for Health Professions Education. The study primarily focused on discerning the didactic preferences related to patient-centred digital teaching regarding family medical video consultations. We provided a detailed explanation of a concrete learning concept, a family medical synchronous distance learning seminar. Subsequently, we surveyed students to gauge their needs, expectations, and evaluations of this concept. The collected data were subjected to descriptive analysis.
Results: The analysis revealed that students aspire to offer video consulting services to their patients in the future (sample size (n) = 369, median (med) = 68 of 101 Likert scale points, interquartile range (IQR) = 53.75), despite having limited knowledge in this area (n = 353, med = 21, IQR = 33.25). To acquire expertise in telehealth, students favor blended learning models (n = 331, med = 76, IQR = 50). They also recognize the beneﬁts of distance learning, particularly for students with family responsibilities or those who must travel long distances to their learning institutions,. The presented distance seminar concept resonated with them (n = 278, med = 72.5, IQR = 50.5), surpassing ﬁve other digital learning models in preference. Furthermore, they expressed a desire for its continued implementation beyond the Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (n = 188, med = 77.5, IQR = 44.75).
Conclusions: The deﬁciency in medical school education regarding video consultations requires attention. This issue could be resolved by integrating one of the ﬁve distance learning concepts outlined in this article.},

This study aims to provide clarity by conducting a meta-analysis of empirical publications that examine students’ deep learning outcomes in relation to digital technology. A comprehensive search of databases and a thorough literature review yielded 60 high-quality, peer-reviewed journal articles that met the inclusion criteria. Using Review Manager 5.4.1 software, a meta-analysis was conducted to assess the overall effectiveness of digital technology. The calculated effect size indicates a positive influence of digital technology on students’ deep learning outcomes. Furthermore, a moderator variable analysis revealed several significant findings: 1. Different categories of digital technology tools have a favorable impact on deep learning outcomes; 2. The duration of digital technology treatment does not significantly affect deep learning outcomes; 3. Digital technology demonstrates a highly positive influence on deep learning within the humanities and social sciences disciplines; 4. Combining online and offline utilization of digital technology in education leads to a substantially greater enhancement in deep learning compared to relying solely on online methods; 5. The effectiveness of digital technology on deep learning is enhanced when accompanied by appropriate instructional guidance; 6. Utilizing digital technology in a systematic manner produces different outcomes compared to fragmented approaches, highlighting the importance of a cohesive implementation; 7. Integrating digital technology with collaborative learning has a more pronounced effect on deep learning compared to independent learning. These findings contribute to our understanding of the impact of digital technology on deep learning outcomes and underscore the importance of thoughtful integration and instructional support in educational contexts.},

The focus is on the role of social presence, which enables enables a sense of community and interaction in digital teaching settings despite physical absence. Based on the concepts of embodied cognition and telepresence, the paper discusses how physical distance can be bridged in virtual learning environments. It suggests teaching methods and technologies that promote a strong social presence, thereby creating an effective and inclusive learning environment. In this context, specific examples are presented that illuminate the dynamic interactions between physical and virtual presence and their significance for designing digital teaching and learning settings. This aims to illustrate ways in which a sense of community and interaction can be created in digital learning environments despite physical distance.},

	abstract = {Background  In the dynamic field of pharmacy amongst a diverse array of countries with disparate income levels, pharmacists play a pivotal role in integrating emerging scientific knowledge into their practice while adapting to evolving therapeutic interventions and expanding service delivery responsibilities. Lifelong Learning (LLL) is cultivated through continuing professional education (CPE) and continuing professional development (CPD), indispensable components ensuring sustained professional competence and heightened patient care quality. The global landscape witnesses diverse LLL activities tailored to pharmacists’ learning needs and preferences. This scoping review maps and synthesises a comprehensive global perspective on the existing knowledge regarding CPE/CPD models, statutory requirements, and pharmacists’ preferences for LLL activities.
Objective  To comprehensively investigate global models of CPE/CPD for pharmacists’ and examine the statutory requirements governing pharmacists’ registration and licensure.
Method  A literature search of PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and the University of KwaZulu-Natal library search engine was undertaken for studies between January 2012 and February 2023. The article selection and reporting followed the recommendations made by PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. The articles were tabulated based on their respective country’s income level, continuing education models employed, country-specific statutory requirements, and pharmacists’ preferences for LLL activities.
Results  Of the initial 3974 publications identified through the database search, 24 studies met the review criteria. The majority of the articles originated from high-income countries (HICs) (14/24, 58.3\%), and most employed the mandatory CPD points system (21/24, 87.5\%). However, in some HICs and upper-middle income countries (UMICs), the CPE/CPD is non-mandatory. While most countries (19/24, 79.2\%) offer various LLL formats, the preference of pharmacists remains primarily face-to-face learning (13/24, 54.2\%). However, workplace learning (3/24, 12.5\%) and blended learning (7/24, 29.1\%) are mentioned in some studies.
Conclusion  Diverse models of CPE/CPD alongside statutory requirements persist globally and evolve, shaped by varied implementation experiences. HICs lead in CPD models, while the implementation in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and low-income countries (LICs) requires further exploration for inclusivity and effectiveness. A few},

Blended education has been found, even before the COVID-19 pandemic, to increase the level of education and stimulate effective learning for postgraduate healthcare professionals. Interprofessional education is critical for preparing students to enter the health workforce, where teamwork and collaboration are important competencies. This article outlines the key points of the Blended Intensive Programme’s implementation in dental education organised by Wroclaw Medical University in Poland. BIP involved professors from 12 universities or research institutions from Europe and South America and 28 participants from 8 countries. The course was taught remotely and in person. In addition, it included a visit to the university and practical classes with artificial simulation and practice in dentistry. A structured questionnaire enabled measuring the evaluation of students’ perception of the COVID-19 education before and after the pandemic. The European Region Action Scheme for the Mobility of University Students (ERASMUS) was fundamental to carrying out the BIP with the participation of several countries, allowing the exchange of knowledge, assessing the impact of the pandemic on dental universities, and strengthening international collaborations and the future project of research, education and clinical assistance. We conclude that hybrid teaching programmes broaden the learning spectrum in dental studies by allowing transnational and interdisciplinary approaches that make students aware of the importance of their work within the framework of the general health approach, as this differs from country to country.},

The digitalization of patient education offers potential to enhance effectiveness, but requires new competencies from therapy providers. Educational science presents digital competence frameworks for designing training and enhancing educational outcomes. However, there is a lack of competence models or corresponding assessment tools for obesity therapy. Therefore, the objective is to determine competence structures for the planning and implementation of digital therapy. The development of the questionnaire involved a literature review to identify applicable competence conceptualizations. Content analysis was employed to extract dimensions and items. To validate the questionnaire, experts were interviewed. Based on literature, the questionnaire contains three subjects: therapy-appropriate competences, competence moderators, and demographic information, which comprise 16 dimensions (e.g., media adaptation, digital learning monitoring) in 46 items. Expert feedback (n = 11) resulted in 40 revisions on language and content. The average completion time was 8.8 minutes. For the first time, competence structures for the planning and implementation of digital obesity therapy were identified based on literature and expert interviews. Following the statistical validation, the influence of competences on therapy effectiveness can be investigated and conclusions can be drawn for training.},

Sowohl als eigenes Fach „Digitale Grundbildung“, als auch als fächerübergreifende Kompetenz „Medienbildung“ ist sie im formellen Bildungssystem unserer Kinder und Jugendlichen verankert. Digitale (Grund-)Bildung baut in Österreich auf drei Säulen auf: informatische Bildung, Medienbildung und Gestaltungskompetenz. Aktuelle Diskussionen drehen sich vor allem um die informatische Bildung, also eine praktisch anwendende Geisteshaltung, die – im Sinne des Computational Thinking – problemzentriert und lösungsorientiert ausgerichtet ist. Durch sie werden konkrete technische Aufgabenstellungen gelöst, ihr Ziel ist die einwandfreie Funktion, das Beseitigen von Fehlern und das Verstehen informatischer Systeme. Hin und wieder stößt man auch auf medienpädagogische Ansätze der „medienkritisch“ hinterfragenden Haltung der Medienbildung, die um die sozialen und persönlichen Implikationen von Techniknutzung genauso weiß wie um problematische gesellschaftliche Prozesse, wie sie Dieter Baacke schon in den 1990er-Jahren ausgemacht hat (Baacke 1996).},

	abstract = {Der Beitrag nimmt ethische Implikationen ausgewählter Ansätze des kritischen Posthumanismus in den Blick und verfolgt dabei das Ziel, Anregungspotenziale für die Medienpädagogik aufzuzeigen. Ausgangsposition stellt die mehrfach anzutreffende Diagnose dar, derzufolge klassische Subjektkonzeptionen, die vor allem auf im Humanismus verankerte Ideale und Werte rekurrieren, zunehmend unzulänglich erscheinen, um Agencies postdigitaler und posthumaner Kulturen adäquat zu fassen. Davon ausgehend werden divergente Haltungen in der Medienpädagogik ausgelotet: es wird deutlich, dass die dargestellten Entwicklungen einerseits ein Wiederaufleben humanistischer Ideale zur Folge haben, wobei diese auf das digitale Zeitalter projiziert werden und eine – vor allem moralische – Sonderstellung des Menschen in Anbetracht anthropologischer Ungewissheit bekräftigen. Andererseits lässt sich ein zunehmendes Unbehagen angesichts des Festhaltens an vielfach als unzeitgemäss wahrgenommenen Subjektkonzeptionen als Fluchtpunkt pädagogischer Tätigkeit erkennen. Als mögliche Alternative wird eine Abkehr vom Humanismus, wie sie beispielsweise in den Positionen des kritischen Posthumanismus angestrebt wird, vorgeschlagen. Mögliche Spielarten sollen exemplarisch anhand der Positionen von drei Vertreter:innen des kritischen Posthumanismus aufgezeigt werden, wobei ethische Aspekte im Fokus stehen. Der Beitrag diskutiert abschliessend, worin die Stärken und Schwächen möglicher alternativer Subjektkonstruktionen und deren ethische Implikationen liegen. Damit soll der Beitrag, ausgehend von der Gegenüberstellung der Positionen, als Eröffnung einer Diskussion dienen.},

	abstract = {Blended learning combines online and traditional classroom instruction, aiming to optimize educational outcomes. Despite its potential, student engagement with online components remains a significant challenge. Gamification has emerged as a popular solution to bolster engagement, though its effectiveness is contested, with research yielding mixed results. This study addresses this gap by examining the impact of adaptive gamified assessments on young learners’ motivation and language proficiency within a blended learning framework. Under Self-Determination Theory (SDT) and Language Assessment Principles, the study evaluates how adaptive gamified tests affect learner engagement and outcomes. A 20-week comparative experiment involved 45 elementary school participants in a blended learning environment. The experimental group (n = 23) took the adaptive gamified test, while the control group (n = 22) engaged with non-gamified e-tests. Statistical analysis using a paired t-test in SPSS revealed that the implementation of adaptive gamified testing in the blended learning setting significantly decreased learner dissatisfaction (t (44) = 10.13, p {\textless} .001, SD = 0.87). Moreover, this approach markedly improved learners’ accuracy rates (t (44) = -25.75, p {\textless} .001, SD = 2.09), indicating enhanced language proficiency and motivation, as also reflected in the attitude scores (t(44) = -14.47, p {\textless} .001, SD = 4.73). The adaptive gamified assessment primarily enhanced intrinsic motivation related to competence, with 69\% of students in the experimental group reporting increased abilities. The findings suggest that adaptive gamified testing is an effective instructional method for fostering improved motivation and learning outcomes.},

Specifically, teachers need basic digital skills as well as technology-related teaching skills. Assessment instruments are helpful in facilitating these skills in the process of teacher education. Existing instruments, however, mostly rely on simple, often very generally formulated self-assessments. This makes a valid measurement difficult. This paper presents an alternative approach that contextualises self-assessments of technology-related skills by means of scenarios and thus makes them more precise. The scenario-based approach leads to a valid measurement but has the disadvantage that it is more extensive. In this paper, we develop a short scale in a multi-stage procedure. Based on a data set of N = 552 (prospective) teachers, a scenario-based short scale is developed to measure instrumental and critical digital skills as well as technologyrelated teaching skills. We will validate the resulting short scale again in another study with N = 204 teachers. Results of both studies support the validity of the short scale. Thus, for teacher education and research, an acceptance-promoting and resource-saving instrument is provided that allows a reliable and valid measurement of instrumental and critical digital skills as well as technology-related teaching skills.},

	abstract = {Knowledge convergence, originating from computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL), is often defined as building a shared cognitive understanding through social interactions. With an increasing focus on large-scale collaboration and online learning in CSCL, it is crucial to examine how knowledge convergence occurs in online settings. This study investigates how learners develop cognitive consensus in online discussions and assess how social interactions and learners’ role influence these dynamics in a MOOC using video-based social annotation. Mixed-methods, including Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA), Simulation Investigation for Empirical Network Analysis (SIENA), and role trajectory clustering were employed. The findings suggest that cognitive consensus in discussions originates from sharing similar experiences and evolves into more advanced levels over time. Reciprocity and transitivity are crucial for establishing network cohesion while achieving cognitive consensus. Learners with similar role trajectories tend to interact together. This study expands the traditional CSCL paradigm by examining how social interactions shape discussion network dynamics and how learners’ role trajectories influence these dynamics. We argue that network cohesiveness should be included in the framework of online knowledge convergence, alongside cognitive consensus. Dynamic network analysis is essential for understanding the complex mechanisms driving online knowledge convergence occurring, where the cognitive and social attributes of learning are interwoven.},

This study provides novelty by confirming the relationship among the BTBL constructs and extending the model to determine the chain-mediation effects of BTBL in influencing CR. These imply that BTBL enhances learners’ competencies through social learning. As a pedagogical implication, this study recommends that T\&H educators develop CR and related industry skills by implementing BTBL activities, which provide learners exposure to “real-world” scenarios and autonomy to discuss collaboratively and make critical decisions as a team.},

	abstract = {Background Contemporary dental education requires swift assimilation of technological advancements to prepare the future generation of dentists. Integrating digital tools, such as prepCheck software in crown preparations offers a promising avenue for enhancing the learning experiences of dental students. This study aimed to evaluate the perceptions and experiences of undergraduate dental students regarding the use of PrepCheck software for learning crown preparations.
Methods An interventional study design was employed to investigate the perceptions of undergraduate dental students regarding the use of Sirona prepCheck software their learning experiences in the prosthodontics course at the College of Dental Medicine. were recruited using purposive sampling. Participants received training on crown preparations using standard didactic and practical teaching methods. A total of 64 dental students (Mean age 22.4 years) participated in the study. They were randomly assigned to two groups, 32 participants each. The study group utilized prepCheck software and the control group relied solely on supervisor feedback. Both groups completed their crown preparation labs concurrently, ensuring consistency in training and assessment conditions.
Results Out of a total number of 66 students enrolled on the course, 64 participated in the study giving a response rate of 96.96\%. The overall mean score for all items was 1.01 (95\%CI 0.77–1.25), indicating positive perceptions of the participants about prepCheck software. Analysis of variance revealed no significant variation by gender. Thematic analysis of open-ended items identified key themes related to the advantages and challenges of using prepCheck. Advantages included immediate self-evaluation, objective analysis, and feedback, while challenges included operational difficulties and cost concerns.
Conclusion This study provides insights into the effectiveness of prepCheck in dental education, offering perspectives derived from both quantitative and qualitative analyses. A majority of the participants recommended that digital assessment should be integrated with conventional methods, underscoring the importance of human input through supervisor feedback. The study demonstrates the potential of prepCheck software in enhancing participants’ learning experiences in crown preparation assessment.

	abstract = {Background Point of Care ultrasound (POCUS) is rapidly gaining popularity in resource constrained settings. Optimising training is important to ensure safe and effective implementation. To expand POCUS expertise in Ghana, we co-developed and piloted a context specific, multi-disciplinary, blended learning programme, targeted at physicians of any grade or speciality providing acute care in the public health sector. In this retrospective mixed method study, we capture the “real world” experience of participants, using POCUS in their daily practice, as well as the barriers and enablers they perceived to implementation.
Results Eight emergency and internal medicine specialists and residents participated, working across three teaching hospitals, treating both general and specialist patients. They implemented each POCUS application taught, with cardiac indications, inferior vena cava (IVC) assessment, deep venous thrombosis (DVT) diagnosis, lung/pleural assessment and peripheral vascular access being most frequent at 3–6 times/week. An estimated 40\% of patients could not have afforded any other diagnostic tests. They considered the pilot curriculum adequate for general practice and the majority of applications of low difficulty (71\%). For cases sent for second opinion, they are selfreported that their findings were confirmed in 60–78\% of cases. Perceptions about the relative advantage of POCUS over the usual approaches to diagnosing patients enabled implementation. Generally, they believed that POCUS improved their clinical decision making and that more certified training courses need to be run at lower cost to make them more accessible. All participants valued ongoing connections after training to ask for help and consolidate their skills. Continued evaluation and reflection on their POCUS practice to improve quality was unanimously reported as important, yet none had a formal system for this. The strongest barrier was access to equipment and maintenance. A lack of training opportunities and local mentors, and negative beliefs from other departments and hospital administration were further barriers.
Conclusion Our new blended learning curriculum met the needs of physicians caring for patients with general and specialist presentations, with strong reported positive experience of improved bedside diagnostic capabilities, especially for the large proportion of patients unable to afford or access alternative diagnostic tests.

	abstract = {This study investigates the perspectives of teachers and students on the effectiveness of synchronous and asynchronous learning approaches in enhancing English speaking skills, focusing on grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation, fluency, and comprehension. Conducted in a junior high school setting in Indonesia, the research employs a qualitative descriptive method, collecting data through semi-structured interviews with three teachers and three students. Thematic analysis was applied to explore patterns and themes in participants' responses. The findings reveal that synchronous learning fosters real-time interaction, enhancing vocabulary acquisition and comprehension through immediate feedback. However, challenges such as grammatical inaccuracies and low student confidence persist. Asynchronous learning provides students with the flexibility to refine their tasks, improving grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation, but lacks the immediacy of feedback essential for addressing comprehension and pronunciation errors in real-time. The study underscores the complementary nature of these modalities, highlighting the potential of a blended or bichronous approach to optimize learning outcomes. The research contributes to the discourse on distance education by offering practical insights into integrating synchronous and asynchronous learning for language instruction. Recommendations include strategic lesson planning, teacher training in digital tools, and addressing infrastructural challenges to ensure equitable access. The study also suggests further exploration of bichronous learning models and their impact on long-term language proficiency. This research provides valuable guidance for educators and policymakers aiming to enhance English language education in digital and hybrid learning environments.},

This study aims to explore the impact of blended learning on students’ academic performance, engagement, and self-efficacy in a medical nutrition course.
Methods A mixed-method research design was employed, involving 110 undergraduate students enrolled in a blended learning medical nutrition course and a control group of 93 students from a traditional learning environment. Data collection included academic performance assessments, semi-structured interviews, and an anonymous questionnaire. Quantitative data were analyzed using t-tests and chi-square tests, while qualitative data were subjected to thematic analysis.
Results Students in the blended learning group demonstrated significantly higher self-efficacy, particularly in organizing their study plans, participating in interactive learning activities, and applying course knowledge. Academic performance was notably better in collaborative assessments, such as group discussions and exploratory projects, in the blended learning group compared to the control group. Qualitative analysis revealed that students appreciated the flexibility and engagement offered by the blended learning model, although they also faced challenges related to self-discipline and the learning environment.
Conclusions The blended learning approach enhances student engagement, self-efficacy, and collaborative skills, particularly in group-based assessments. While students benefit from the flexibility and richness of learning resources, challenges related to self-discipline and learning environments need to be addressed to optimize the effectiveness of blended learning.},

An extensive body of previous investigations has recognised the potential of instructional games to advance the learning of appropriate work life skills. However, there seems to be a lack of understanding in the current literature regarding the students’ views towards meaningful ways to collaborate in virtual teams during educational activities. The current study is contextualised by a business simulation game and examines university students' experiences through working collaboratively in multi-site teams. In that context, the focus is on the fostering and hampering aspects of virtual collaboration as experienced by the students during the simulation sessions. The study was executed among 66 undergraduate university students in Finland. The data were collected from the students' reflection papers and were then analysed using a qualitative content analysis approach. The evidence shows that students experienced fostering and hampering aspects in relation to communication, collaboration, organising, and technology during the simulated sessions. As these are all very typical to modern distributed collaborative work, we may conclude that the GBL course presented in this study provided students with opportunities to experience and rehearse collaborative virtual teamwork in an authentic work context. Our findings highlight the importance of allowing students to practice 21st century skills in an authentic, safe and stimulating environment. Simulation games provide a feasible context for doing so.},

	abstract = {An adaptive learning system provides support for student’s academic progress by varying learning routes and pedagogical contents to satisfy various students’ unique academic needs. The primary goal of this research work is to enhance and expand occupational efficiency through the use of technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPCK) frameworks in nursing education. The authors developed an adaptive federated cloud computing learning system in order to better prepare students for the demands of real-world professional practice. The article examined the use of virtual reality(VR) and augmented (AR) technologies in nursing education and developed an instrument that skillfully combines knowledge from the reputable literature on clinical competencies with the peculiarities and ingenuousness particular to virtual simulations. Designated for the remote sharing and utilization of combined educational resources, cloud computing is a distributed information communication technology (ICT) infrastructure built on the Internet of Things (IoT) framework. To increase the occupational efficiency among the nurses and midwives, an educational simulation applied in a way that gamifies the curriculum component for interactive educational pedagogy will be necessary. As a completely integrated part of the curriculum, simulation has proven to be beneficial for nursing students at all levels of instruction. Nursing educators have a plethora of options at their disposal to introduce simulation-based learning approaches into their curricula in the modern era. A threedimensional (3D) interactive environment that provides users with a sense of spatial presence is created through computer technology, which is an immersive digital ecosystem of VR and AR utilized to improve teaching and learning in nursing education. In this study, the authors offered a cost- effective clinical simulation laboratory for clinical students, nurses, midwives, and practicing healthcare professionals in a manner that ensures constant learning and occupational efficiency by adopting the TPCK model in its central discussion and implementation. The TPCK model has demonstrated how to recognize the boundaries between technological components and pedagogical structures as well as how they are connected when creating facts in nursing education.},

Many researchers around the world have conducted studies to define CT, to develop CT in students, and to assess CT using various tools and paradigms. Our review focuses on the assessment aspect of CT using digital games. Typically, the assessment in CT is done using Multiple Choice Questions, Portfolio analysis, pen-and-paper methods, and games. The use of video games to assess CT skills was one of the least explored areas. To further explore this area, we did a systematic literature review on the use of video games to assess CT. The findings of our review are as follows: (1) CT skills such as abstraction, algorithmic thinking, data representation, debugging, decomposition, pattern recognition, recursive thinking, simulation, socialization, heuristic, iteration, and problem-solving were primarily assessed using digital games. (2) The reviewed articles used samples ranging from 18 to 3355 participants. (3) The sample includes elementary, middle-, and high-school and graduate students. (4) In the reviewed articles, it is observed that the time for treatment varied from a few hours to the entire school year. (5) A mixed-mode study using quantitative and qualitative methods was preferred by researchers to explore the CT aspects such as CT concepts, practices, and perspectives. (6) The use of video games, stealth assessment, educational data mining and machine learning for assessing CT skills is in a dormant state. (7) There is a lack of empirical evidence to prove that video games are effective to assess CT skills.

Patients and methods: German individuals with skin conditions completed a questionnaire assessing health-related digital media use, eHealth literacy, impact of digital media use on the patient-physician relationship and patient journey, and sociodemographic and health characteristics from June to November 2022, followed by descriptive analysis and linear regressions.
Results: Overall, 919 participants were analyzed (median age: 47.00, interquartile range [28.00; 61.00] years, female: 53.6\%, health-related digital media users: 56.8\%). Google and online encyclopedias were commonly used before and after dermatological consultations. Online self-help groups were used by 75\% of nontreated participants. Digital media use had no impact on the patient-physician relationship and a positive impact on the patient journey. Positive impacts were associated with higher eHealth literacy, satisfaction with digital media quality, importance of digital media, rural residence, high education, and trust in dermatologists.
Conclusions: The potential of health-related digital media in office-based dermatological care necessitates the drive of an evidence-based digital health platform to improve eHealth literacy and satisfaction with the quality of digital media among affected individuals.},

              Hintergrund
              Im Zuge der Neustrukturierung des Medizinstudiums werden erstmalig auch praktische Kompetenzen als Lernziele klar definiert. Zur effektiven Nutzung der kurzen Präsenzzeit, die im Fach HNO-Heilkunde zur Verfügung steht, war das Ziel dieser Studie die Verzahnung der Vermittlung praktischer Fertigkeiten unter Zuhilfenahme von „flipped classroom“, digitaler Lehre und einem neu errichteten SkillsLab zu evaluieren.
            
            
              Material und Methoden
              
                Im Rahmen des HNO-Praktikums wurden die Studierenden in 2 Gruppen unterteilt: Gruppe A = 93 Studierende (männlich
                n
                 = 42, weiblich
                n
                 = 51), Gruppe B = 113 Studierende (männlich
                n
                 = 42, weiblich
                n
                 = 71). Sie bearbeiteten zunächst digital zur Verfügung gestelltes Material, welches einzelne HNO-Untersuchungen erläuterte. Anschließend erfolgte der Präsenzunterricht in Kleingruppen, welcher eine Hospitation und Übungen der Untersuchungstechniken beinhaltete. Während Gruppe A diese dozentengeführt an Modellen absolvierte und sich gegenseitig untersuchte, erhielt Gruppe B den Unterricht anhand strukturierter Arbeitsstationen im hierfür neu errichteten HNO-SkillsLab. Die Effekte auf die Motivation und subjektiven Kompetenzen wurden anhand eines eigens für diese Studie entwickelten Fragebogens gemessen.
              
            
            
              Ergebnisse
              
                Nach Bearbeitung des digitalen Materials zeigte sich in beiden Gruppen ein hohes Level an Motivation und Kompetenz. Im Verlauf des Präsenztags zeigte sich ein Zugewinn an Motivation und Kompetenz, welcher nur in der SkillsLab-Gruppe statistisch signifikant war (
                p
                 {\textless} 0,001). Obwohl die SkillsLab-Gruppe vor dem Präsenztag in ihrer subjektiven Kompetenz unterlegen war, zeigte sie sich nach dem Präsenztag der anderen Gruppe hierin sogar überlegen.
              
            
            
              Schlussfolgerung
              Die Kombination eines digitalen „flipped classroom“ mit strukturierten Arbeitsstationen im Rahmen eines SkillsLabs ermöglicht eine effektivere Vermittlung praktischer Kompetenzen, welche sich in der statistisch signifikanten Steigerung von Motivation und Selbsteinschätzung der Gruppe B widerspiegelt. Dabei erleichtert insbesondere die digitale Befunderhebung die Überprüfung der individuellen Lernerfolge und regt die Diskussion an.

            Abstract
            
              Background
              In the course of the restructuring of medical studies, practical competencies are clearly defined as learning objectives for the first time. In order to make most effective use of the short attendance time available in otolaryngology, the aim of this study was to teach practical skills with the help of flipped classroom, digital teaching, and a newly established SkillsLab.
            
            
              Materials and methods
              
                During their ENT internship, two groups of students—group A = 93 students (male
                n
                 = 42, female
                n
                 = 51) and group B = 113 students (male
                n
                 = 42, female
                n
                 = 71)—first worked through material provided online, which explained the individual examinations. This was followed by face-to-face teaching, which consisted of observation and practical exercise of the different examination techniques. While group A practiced on each other or on dummies, group B used structured workstations in the ENT SkillsLab, which was newly built for this purpose. The effects on motivation and subjective competence were measured using a questionnaire developed for this study.
              
            
            
              Results
              
                After working through the online material, both groups showed a high level of motivation and competence. On the day of face-to-face teaching, there was a gain in motivation and competence, which was statistically significant only in the SkillsLab group (
                p
                 {\textless} 0.001). Although the SkillsLab group was inferior in terms of its subjective competence at the beginning, it was superior to the other group after the face-to-face teaching.
              
            
            
              Conclusion
              Combination of digitized teaching in the flipped classroom with structured workstations in the setting of a SkillsLab enables more effective teaching of practical skills, which was reflected by increases in motivation and subjective competence in group B. In particular, the presentation of all collected findings on monitors allows verification of learning success and stimulates discussion.},

However, some research indicates reluctance to do this, due to perceived limitations of young children and notions about what is and is not ‘appropriate’ for them learn. This study examines this proposition, through analysis of 6 and 7 year olds’ application of ‘Technoliteracy’ capabilities during a unit of learning about Matariki (the Maori new year). It used an updated and expanded revision of Durrant and Green’s (2000) l(IT)eracy capability model, to understand how the students applied ‘Technoliteracy’ capabilities to online research and production of an information artefact for an identified audience. Although results were mixed, data was found of students’ productive engagement of ‘Technoliteracy’ capabilities aligned with Durrant and Green’s dimensions, suggesting that with developmentally-appropriate curriculum and pedagogy they were capable of integrating these for meaning making, judging meaning quality, and meaning sharing and communication. Given increasingly ubiquitous access to devices from a young age, results indicate that serious consideration should be given to teaching basic ‘Technoliteracy’ capabilities in early years classrooms.},

Consequently, the question of how schools are made visible and (re)enacted through visual structures on data-mediated interfaces more broadly – what we call Graphic Data Visualisations (GDV) – has remained under-researched. Addressing that research gap, this study specifically scrutinises the role of GDV as non-human actors within the design process of a Moodle-based learning management system (LMS) in four schools. Following a critical co-design approach, the potential of GDV to reflect on how the visual design shapes educational practices, and to adapt it according to pedagogical and organisational needs is explored. Focusing on ‘critical incidents’ in the design process, we found that local practices substantially influenced the data-based, visual enactment of a school through specific GDV. At the same time, the use of certain GDV enhanced a general critical engagement with datafication among school actors.},

	abstract = {In the era of innovative societal development, virtual reality technologies are becoming an integral tool in the educational process. This article aims to analyse the potential of immersive technologies in implementing virtual learning environments in educational institutions in Ukraine. It has been found that immersive technologies are rapidly evolving from being an innovation to a practical and widely used range of tools. The study established that their implementation into the educational policy paradigm is seen as a promising necessity and a factor in intensifying the quality of education. The essence of the phenomenon of immersive technologies has been specified, with their components distinguished, including objective reality, virtual reality, and augmented reality. The specifics of involving immersive technologies in the educational process in Ukrainian educational institutions have been highlighted. An experiment was conducted involving virtual reality technologies in the professional educational environment of future fire safety specialists through the VR programme FLAIM Systems. During the study of the peculiarities of virtual reality technologies in educational modelling, the priority advantages and associated risks of their integration were highlighted. It was found that the potential of immersive technologies stimulates the optimisation of understanding complex concepts and significantly expands the toolkit of future industry specialists. It was determined that engaging visualisations and the experience of using virtual reality technologies offer an intuitive approach to rather abstract concepts that are difficult to reproduce within the framework of classical pedagogical technologies. It has been substantiated that using virtual reality technologies in the educational and management process has significant advantages over the traditional methodology of educational processes, as it actively engages the sensory system and emotional sphere. It has been proven that virtual reality (VR programmes) has significant potential to positively impact the quality of education in educational institutions in Ukraine.},

Resilience can be understood as a crucial capability for adaptability in the teaching profession. Resilient teachers are better able to overcome adverse situations and adapt to changes. They are also less likely to leave the profession. Although the importance of teacher resilience is widely recognized, there is little knowledge about effective strategies to promote this ability. Digital learning environments designed according to media pedagogical and media didactic principles offer promising approaches here, as they create flexible, personalized, and interactive learning opportunities that allow teachers to test and reflect on resilience strategies in a protected space. The project «Fostering Resilience in Teacher Education (FoResT)», a collaboration between the University of Bern and the Bern University of Teacher Education, addresses this research gap by developing a media-didactically designed online learning platform for teaching resilience strategies.},

	abstract = {Background  The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel e-learning module in teaching the physical exam of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) in Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA.).
Methods  An e-learning module was developed to convey the TMJ physical examination maneuvers that are considered to be best practice in JIA. Pediatric rheumatology fellows were randomized to two groups. One group received an article describing the physical examination skills while the second group received both the article and module. All participants completed a written pre-test, an in-person objective structured clinical examination (OSCE), a written post-test, and a follow-up survey.
Results  Twenty-two pediatric rheumatology fellows enrolled, with 11 per group. Written test: The two groups improved equally, although there was a trend toward improved defining of maximal incisal opening (MIO) in the module group. OSCE: The mean OSCE score was 11.1 (SD 3.3) in the article group and 13.5 (SD 1.9) in the module group (p = 0.06); significant differences were seen in measuring MIO (p = 0.01), calculating maximal unassisted mouth opening (MUMO; p = 0.01), and assessment of facial symmetry (p = 0.03), all favoring the module. Enjoyment scores in the module group were higher than in the article group (mean 7.7/10 vs. 5.9/10, p = 0.02). The two groups self-reported performing TMJ examinations at comparable rates three months following the intervention.
Conclusions  The study demonstrated that a formalized educational program improved knowledge of the physical exam of the TMJ in JIA. Learners viewing the module were more adept at obtaining quantitative TMJ measurements.},

	abstract = {Rapid technological advances have transformed medical education, particularly in radiology, which depends on advanced imaging and visual data. Traditional electronic learning (e-learning) platforms have long served as a cornerstone in radiology education, offering rich visual content, interactive sessions, and peer-reviewed materials. They excel in teaching intricate concepts and techniques that necessitate visual aids, such as image interpretation and procedural demonstrations. However, Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT), an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered language model, has made its mark in radiology education. It can generate learning assessments, create lesson plans, act as a round-the-clock virtual tutor, enhance critical thinking, translate materials for broader accessibility, summarize vast amounts of information, and provide real-time feedback for any subject, including radiology. Concerns have arisen regarding ChatGPT's data accuracy, currency, and potential biases, especially in specialized fields such as radiology. However, the quality, accessibility, and currency of e-learning content can also be imperfect. To enhance the educational journey for radiology residents, the integration of ChatGPT with expert-curated e-learning resources is imperative for ensuring accuracy and reliability and addressing ethical concerns. While AI is unlikely to entirely supplant traditional radiology study methods, the synergistic combination of AI with traditional e-learning can create a holistic educational experience.},

This study examined the effects of elaborative feedback on students’ reading comprehension skills: inference, reading for gist, and detail reading. The study followed a pre-test post-test quasi-experimental design in which a total of 43 students were involved. The students took a paper-based reading comprehension test before the training was given to measure their current performance. The Moodle Cloud learning management system was used to train the participants of the study. The training was given twice a week for two months. Data were analyzed using mean, paired samples t-test, Cohen’s d and NVIVO software. It was found that there was a statistically significant difference for inference questions before and after the intervention of web based feedback (t = −10.85, sig. = 0.000 and Cohen’s d = 1.63). Similarly, the mean difference for detail reading questions was statistically significant before and after the use of online elaborative feedback (t = −7.340, sig. = 0.000 and Cohen’s d = 1.11). The mean difference of the main idea questions was also statistically significant (t = −6.443, sig. = 0.000, and Cohen’s d = 0.98). The findings clearly show that students’ reading comprehension sub-skills improved after the treatment of the online elaborative feedback provided to the students. The effect size test conducted using Cohen’s d also indicated that the improvements students made in all the sub-skills tested were quite substantial. Thus, as online elaborative feedback has a considerable contribution to improving students’ reading comprehension skills, instructors are encouraged to facilitate situations for online elaborative feedback for their students.},

The Young Innovative Leadership Program (YILP) designed for undergraduate and postgraduate medical sciences students, implemented at the Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, aimed to cultivate leadership capacities through a 16-week training program. This program comprises ten modules covering innovation, change leadership, and management skills, with mentor-facilitated group discussions. This study aimed to provide a qualitative report of the experiences of participants in the YILP.
Methods  A qualitative study was conducted in 2022, three months after the end of the training program, to investigate the participants’ perspectives. Data was extracted through in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 14 participants.
Results  In this study 14 undergraduate and postgraduate medical sciences students who had participated in the YILP the previous year were included. Four main categories emerged from the interviews: “emergence of new horizons”, “values as beacon”, “an expanded toolbox”, and “program’s structure: a learning atmosphere”.
Conclusions  The results of our study indicated that medical science students would benefit from leadership development programs. In this regard, the framework utilized to implement YILP could serve as a role model.},

	abstract = {Collaboration is argued to be an important skill, not only in schools and higher education contexts but also in the workspace and other aspects of life. However, simply asking students to work together as a group on a task does not guarantee success in collaboration. Effective collaborative learning requires meaningful interactions among individuals in a group. Recent advances in multimodal data collection tools and AI provide unique opportunities to analyze, model and support these interactions. This study proposes an original method to identify group interactions in real-world collaborative learning activities and investigates the variations in interactions of groups with different collaborative learning outcomes. The study was conducted in a 10-week long post-graduate course involving 34 students with data collected from groups’ weekly collaborative learning interactions lasting {\textasciitilde} 60 min per session. The results showed that groups with different levels of shared understanding exhibit significant differences in time spent and maximum duration of referring and following behaviours. Further analysis using process mining techniques revealed that groups with different outcomes exhibit different patterns of group interactions. A loop between students’ referring and following behaviours and resource management behaviours was identified in groups with better collaborative learning outcomes. The study indicates that the nonverbal behaviours studied here, which can be auto-detected with advanced computer vision techniques and multimodal data, have the potential to distinguish groups with different collaborative learning outcomes. Insights generated can also support the practice of collaborative learning for learners and educators. Further research should explore the cross-context validity of the proposed distinctions and explore the approach’s potential to be developed as a real-world, real-time support system for collaborative learning.},

Through empirical analysis, the paper highlights the porous boundaries of collaborative learning activities within a broader learning ecosystem, emphasizing the significance of personal emotions and social relations in educational contexts. The concept of "community of practice" is examined as a catalyst for transforming organizational cultures and enhancing participatory communication in learning environments. By proposing design principles that prioritize intergenerational, mixed-class, and intersectional dynamics, the paper underscores the importance of diversity and authentic feedback in fostering effective collaboration. Case studies illustrating successful collaborations underscore the importance of clear communication, shared goals, and supportive cultures. Ultimately, the paper offers insights for educators and researchers seeking to leverage digital technologies for enriching collaborative learning experiences within diverse communities of practice.},

The implementation of online learning at UNISA Yogyakarta faced obstacles due to low student participation. Student interest in accessing the LMS is influenced by the quality of the LMS. The results of LMS monitoring and evaluation over the past year showed an average score of 2.28 (categorized as sufficient). Courses with good LMS evaluation scores accounted for 23.6\%. The development of the LMS is an effort to increase student involvement in cognitive, behavioral, emotional, and performance aspects. This research is a collaborative study on LMS development in partnership with Universiti Malaysia Pahang. The development method uses the 4D model (Define, Design, Develop, Disseminate). The measurement of learning engagement, as the impact of CLMS development, was conducted using the Online Student Engagement Scale (OSE) adapted from Dixson (2015). Data analysis employed qualitative analysis and statistical frequency distribution for each engagement component. The results showed that the average engagement of respondents at UNISA Yogyakarta before CLMS development was 74.7, and the post-test average was 78.8, indicating a score increase of 5\% (4.1). Meanwhile, the average engagement score of respondents at UMP was 73.4. The effectiveness test resulted in a p-value of 0.002 (p{\textless}0.05), indicating that CLMS development is effective in improving student learning engagement.

	abstract = {The cognitive aspect is crucial in developing interactive and adaptive systems, including learning management systems (LMS). By understanding human cognitive processes, developers can create adaptive systems that are sustainably used by targeted users. Cognitive traits need to be explored to become part of the user model, especially especially to develop an LMS with an adaptive interface based on cognitive load. However, there is limited research exploring the correlation between cognitive load and adaptive interfaces, as well as the visualization of information, within online learning settings, including those specifically within LMS platforms. Additionally, a lack of understanding of cognitive processes renders the use of LMS static and unable to adapt to learners’ abilities. Therefore, information regarding the specific characteristics or model of cognitive load that accurately represent LMS users as triggers for adaptive interfaces needs to be further examined. A total of four experts in the cognitive field were interviewed. The interview process was conducted in a semi-structured manner to obtain information about problems in the use of e-learning, the nature of cognitive, and the process of capturing cognitive load during learning using LMS. By using a soft system methodology, the results from the interviews are mapped into a cognitive load-based LMS user model design. The initial model design includes information on working memory capacity, task performance (time, true/false rate), learning behavior (learner log), physiological (in a lab scale), and self-reporting (Likert scale). This model design is a promising first step towards a more technical process in developing adaptive and interactive systems.},

At the end of the 14-week teaching period, the tracking data, which were obtained from the learning activities of the students, were analysed. A two-step clustering analysis was carried out to categorise students’ interactions with learning activities. Thus, it was determined that they had low, moderate, and high interactions, respectively. The normal distribution and homogeneity of variances of the variables were checked. ANOVA was used when assumptions were met, and the Kruskal-Wallis test was used when assumptions were met. A significant difference was found between the different behaviour clusters and students’ academic performance. This study showed that students with high levels of interaction according to behaviour patterns also performed well academically. In addition, students’ expectations and motivations for the course were collected and examined using a questionnaire.},

	abstract = {The classiﬁcation of ships using remotely sensed data is increasingly vital for maritime security, environmental monitoring, and commercial applications. Advances in satellite imagery and remote sensing technologies have heightened the need for effective ship classiﬁcation algorithms. A key challenge lies in the variability of ship appearances due to size, shape, orientation, and environmental factors. Ensemble learning, which combines multiple classiﬁers for improved accuracy, has shown promise in this area. However, this method faces issues like increased memory and time complexity, and the inﬂuence of lower-quality models, highlighting the need for model pruning. This study presents a new approach to maritime management through the introduction of an ensemble learning system. The MAGNAT (Maritime mAnaGement eNsemble leArning sysTem) proposal and novel contribution in this paper represent an intelligent ensemble solution that signiﬁcantly enhances ship classiﬁcation in the maritime domain through the adoption of ensemble learning techniques. Incorporating various Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models into the training process, a novel aggregation strategy is devised to eliminate redundant models, retaining only those that actively enhance the learning process. Extensive experiments utilizing a renowned ship dataset were conducted to validate the effectiveness of the framework, ultimately demonstrating its superiority over conventional ensemble solutions.},

	abstract = {Students’ commitment to online collaborative learning poses a significant challenge for higher education institutions. This study explores the factors that affect students’ commitment to Learning Management System (LMS) groups. A conceptual framework is developed that integrates social identity theory, DeLone and McLean’s information systems success model, and Hofstede’s cultural theory. By adopting a quantitative research design, 367 responses were gathered from university students. The data was analyzed using covariance-based structural equation modelling (CB-SEM). The findings reveal that factors such as LMS group identification, adherence to LMS group norms, perceived system quality, perceived service quality, and perceived information quality positively influence students’ commitment to the LMS group. Interestingly, collectivism as a cultural variable moderates the positive relationship between compliance with LMS group norms and commitment to LMS groups. Furthermore, uncertainty avoidance amplified the positive relationships that perceived system quality and information quality had with LMS group commitment. The model presented in this study offers significant predictive power concerning commitment to an LMS group. These findings will provide valuable insights for systems developers, higher education institutions, and instructors aiming to bolster online group commitment within LMS.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            This study investigates the effect of studying with topic maps provided by a self-developed language learning support system on (a) learning perception, (b) learning achievement and (c) variation in learning attitude and motivation, from the perspective of prior learning attitude, motivation and learning style. An analysis was conducted on the learning data of 90 participants for examining pre-test and post-test scores, learning perception, learning style indicators, attitude and motivation rankings before and after the study of target Japanese grammar content with the support of the system. The findings suggest that learners with high attitude/motivation perceived greater development of the habit of “learning from the comparison of related knowledge” and felt more satisfied with the learning situation in the system environment. Furthermore, the learners' attitude towards Japanese grammar learning and their motivation toward Japanese language learning were significantly stronger after the learning activity. It is also observed that (a) learner attitude towards Japanese grammar after studying with the system only had a positive correlation to prior attitudes; and (b) learner motivation towards Japanese language after studying with the system correlated highly with prior motivation and perception of development of the habit of “learning from the comparison of related knowledge.” Finally, from a learning style perspective, the analysis result suggests that “Global learners” expressed a stronger feeling about the usefulness of the comparison function of the system and their increment in motivation after using the system was higher than for “Sequential learners.” Moreover, between learning style indicators in the Sequential/Global dimension and level of learner expertise in the reported mental load scale, a significant interaction effect was found.},

This scoping review aims to analyze the key features, methodologies, and outcomes of research regarding online assessment accommodations for students with disabilities and extract the best recommendations for curricular design in higher education. Exploring Google Scholar, Taylor and Francis, and Web of Science (WoS) databases, a systematic literature search identiﬁed 26 pertinent studies published since 2019. Thematic analysis revealed four main themes: conceptual developments, barriers to online assessment, recommendations for enhanced accessibility, and accessible curriculum design. The ﬁndings indicate that online assessment is increasingly being viewed as a universal assessment approach with accommodations designed to beneﬁt all students. Higher education institutions should promote uniform accommodations by fostering collaboration between support services and instructors for consistent application across all courses. These accommodations could include strategies like enhancing the accessibility of learning management systems through collaboration, designing courses with progress evaluations and constructive feedback, and allowing task revisions until mastery. Additionally, advocating for various assessment formats, including blackboard quizzes, self-marking tests, and multimedia presentations with ﬂexible completion timelines, aims to boost inclusivity. The insights from this review have the potential to drive positive changes in curriculum design, promoting inclusive education for all students in higher education settings.},

	abstract = {Aviation research on artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) has seen signiﬁcant growth as these emerging technologies hold immense potential for supporting both human-centered and technology-centered aspects of civil aircraft operations. This systematic review, following the guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020, was registered on the Open Science Framework (DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/ZR7A3) and focused speciﬁcally on the use of AI, ML, and DL in human-centric ﬂight operations. The review conducted a comprehensive search of databases including Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, as well as online repositories (ResearchGate and Aerospace Research Central) to identify relevant articles published between 2013 and 2023. In total, 32 studies were included, which explored various applications of AI, ML, and DL in aircraft pilots and ﬂight operations. The studies were categorized into four main areas: (i) assessment and management of human factors risks, including AI-assisted data analysis of pilot performance, crew resource management, and ML-based support for pilots’ cognitive workload monitoring, (ii) detection of human errors, with support systems based on ML-based approaches for real-time monitoring and DL models for biometric monitoring of cockpit pilots were identiﬁed for the detection of human errors in ﬂight safety, (iii) reduction and prediction of human errors, categorized into AI-assisted predictive analytics in ﬂight accidents, and ML-based pattern recognition to predict unstable approaches, and (iv) prevention of human errors in aviation through ML utilization for pilot training enhancement, and AI-supporting ﬂight automation and decision support systems for ﬂight operation. Analysis of the included studies revealed a rising trend in the publication of articles after 2020, albeit at a slow rate. It is worth noting that the majority of studies focused on conceptual applications, with fewer studies involving empirical testing. The ﬁndings of this review highlight the potential for future research in developing and testing improved human factors risk assessment (HRA) models assisted by computational intelligence in piloted aircraft operations, with the ultimate aim of enhancing ﬂight safety.},

	abstract = {The problem of internet connectivity in the Philippines has added a heavy burden to the online learning environment and the use of learning management systems by the nursing educational sector. Thus, the researchers developed the Filipinized Learning Management System (FLMS) that addresses the problem of unstable internet connection, is freely accessible, and is responsive to the teaching and learning needs of Filipino nursing faculty and students. Faculty and students were surveyed about their initial experiences and thoughts with the system utilizing a mixed-methods approach, which involved a series of focus group discussions and the use of the Technology-Acceptance Model (TAM) questionnaire. The FLMS’s design features include target user appropriateness, lower and lesser system operating and maintenance requirements, offline features, and multi-modal means of content presentation and communication. Preliminary findings indicate that the Filipinized Learning Management System (FLMS) demonstrated the potential to address connectivity issues, featuring a user-friendly interface and offline capabilities. It facilitated engagement and community building through collaborative tools and discussion boards. However, users also faced notable technical challenges, leading to recommendations for system enhancements. The results of the study prove that developing a learning management system entails a process of assessing and understanding its intended users to maximize its potential effectively. The pilot implementation of the FLMS uncovered vital insights into its ability to mitigate connectivity obstacles and enhance online education in the Philippines. It is challenging yet possible. The study hopes to contribute to the discourse of creating technological advancements in the field of education.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: This study aimed to determine the prevalence, risk factors, symptoms, and awareness of computer vision syndrome (CVS) among medical students during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
METHODS: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted among 283 undergraduate medical students at a tertiary healthcare center. An electronic survey was conducted to collect the data. Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS version 23). The Chi-square test (Fisher's exact test when required) was used to study the significance of associations. A P value {\textless}0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: A high prevalence of CVS was observed in which 92\% reported at least one symptom while using a digital device, the most frequent being eye strain (49\%). Among extraocular complaints, joint pain in the wrist and fingers was most frequent. Significant association (P {\textless} 0.05) of CVS was found with increased duration of digital device usage, refractive error, use of glasses or contact lens, preexisting dry eye disease, and use of topical eye drops. 37\% of the participants were aware of the 20-20-20 rule, while only 11\% followed it.
CONCLUSION: CVS is a common health concern among medical students. Hence, to increase the productivity of work, significant risk factors need to be addressed and awareness must be raised.},

The target group is postgraduate military ofﬁcers from all branches of the armed forces involved in planning and assessing joint military operations. The holistic design of the learning experience consists of ﬁve steps, including three applications in XR: combined embodiment/360° videos, avatar dialogue, and a collaborative virtual map activity. The goal of the XR tools is to trigger an empathetic presence and foster logical reasoning and analytical skills. The XR sessions are supplemented with traditional lectures, peer-to-peer discussions, and a debrieﬁng session. A pilot study in 2022 captured data from a wide range of sources, including self-reporting surveys, physiological data, and visual observations. This article leans on data captured during observation notes and focus group discussions in the aftermath of the study that were videotaped and analyzed thematically. The qualitative pilot study aims to discover if the overarching educational design enhances student engagement with the topic of protection of civilians and offers an alternative approach to teaching it by provoking empathy in XR.},

When assessed following the completion of their respective programs, students in the experimental group outperformed their control counterparts across all subskills assessed. These overall positive literacy outcomes were also mirrored in observations of the demographics considered. The results of this study provide a high-quality contribution to the body of research indicating that usage of CAI can equitably beneﬁt early learners.},

In total, data were collected from Czech primary school teachers of Informatics (N = 229) using a questionnaire. Nine research questions were set that focused on the preference for the new concept, evaluation of respondents’ subject knowledge and didactic skills, consideration of the school equipment, use of new learning materials and teaching methods, main sources of new information in Informatics and teaching Informatics, perceiving the new concept of the Informatics curriculum, in particular, what they consider positive, negative, and what topic/s they miss in the learning content. The results showed that the teachers were not sure of their opinions during and after the transition period, they needed more experience. Therefore, further investigation needs to be conducted that can be carried out continuously every year after the implementation of the new concept, without geographical limits, so that the results could be generalized to the whole population of the country.},

The sample incorporated responses from educators, students and technical personnel from 146 tertiary education institutions. We aimed to identify the institutional, learning- and teaching-related, and personal components that differed in countries signiﬁcantly, as well as the components that contributed to these differences. The discriminant analysis was used. The ﬁndings revealed that all countries are still on the low capacity level for integrating disruptive technologies to e-learning on a large scale. Infrastructural capacity in the countries did not differ signiﬁcantly, but institutional norms and regulations, practices for teaching, and in attitudes and values diverged the countries. These critical elements may be used to develop the capacities in institutions to support the disruptive technology uptake.},

The current digital transformation of the functioning of society opens up broad opportunities in this direction. The article deals with issues: The new concept of a presystem is introduced. As a practice application of this notion chaotic presystem models are considered, for example, such as Chaotic logic. The expressive possibilities of chaotic logic are considered. The notion of a quasi—fractal chaotic logic to show the impossibility of controlling chaos from the standpoint of quasi-fractal logic due to the presence of holes in chaotic logic from the standpoint of non—deterministic chaos. To investigate presystem conditional groups’ probability function and conditional digitalization function are introduced. Conditional groups’ function of digitalization can be used to clarify the qualitative side of the forecast and its connection with the quantitative characteristics. The deﬁnition of a measurement error, connected with conditional digitalization function is given. As a practice application of this notion the explanation of possible causes of forecasting errors in smart systems/in smart university ranking systems, in ﬁnancial—economic systems can be got. Also, the following results are presented: The existence an element in a chaotic closed associative presystem at which any connections are impossible to set. The existence a level in a chaotic closed associative quasi-fractal presystem at which connections are impossible to set.},

	abstract = {In today’s technology-driven world, educators need to understand how students use Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) for educational purposes if they wish to effectively design curricula. Today, students seamlessly navigate various devices, creating complex, nontraditional learning environments from a young age. This means educators must recognize the positive affordances of technology while being cautious of negative aspects. Personalized learning opportunities can be developed by understanding students’ digital learning environments or digital eco-systems through learning analytics. This research aims to map students’ digital eco-system usage patterns to inform course design that aligns with student learning expectations as they relate to learning technology. To contextualize technologies and learning environments, a clear understanding of learners’ technological adoption and use in speciﬁc learning contexts is necessary. Artiﬁcial Intelligence techniques can be employed to better understand participants’ technological adoption and use in collaborative educational activities. In this study, participant activity was captured in log data, and Kernel-Based Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) was applied over one academic year. Key ﬁndings include a consistent decrease in online activity throughout the academic year and students favoring mobile and non-mobile devices at different times during activities, suggesting they selectively utilize different affordances based on context and purpose. If this is the case, it would be an insight into how they are shifting between device types depending on the context and purpose. These ﬁndings provide a clearer understanding of how the students behave within a digital eco-system of interconnected devices that function to support their learning. The results and implications for education were discussed, along with suggestions for future research.},

Students were expected to use the CAI for 20 min a day, ﬁve days a week, during the summer before entering kindergarten. Literacy performance was assessed at the beginning and end of the program, and scores of students who were assigned to the literacy program were compared to the scores of students who were assigned to use the math and science program. Students who used the literacy program scored signiﬁcantly higher in overall literacy and for the subskills of blending and letter recognition than their control group counterparts. Demographic effects were assessed for students experiencing poverty and students of color. For these demographics, students in the experimental group outperformed their control group counterparts in overall literacy scores and blending and letter recognition subskills.},

	abstract = {In digitalized learning processes, learning analytics (LA) can help teachers make pedagogically sound decisions and support pupils’ self-regulated learning (SRL). However, research on the role of the pedagogical dimensions of learning design (LD) in influencing the possibilities of LA remains scarce. Primary school presents a unique LA context characterized by blended learning environments and pupils’ various abilities to regulate their learning, underscoring teachers’ vital importance. This study explores how pedagogically diverse LDs influence pupils’ SRL behaviors and learning management system (LMS) usage, as well as how this is reflected in LA visualizations. Two LDs were designed and implemented in two primary school classes of fifth (n = 30) and sixth (n = 22) graders within authentic pedagogical and technological contexts. We used sequence analysis to examine the pupils’ SRL actions during LDs, using LMS log data and observation data to contextualize these actions. The results show that LA offers less accurate feedback in more open, collaborative LDs as pupils tend to rely less on the LMS to regulate their learning. Furthermore, the teacher powerfully influences LMS usage in blended primary school classrooms. To maximize the potential of using LA to support SRL, its design needs to be grounded in the LD through an understanding of how the regulation of learning is promoted in diverse learning processes.},

	abstract = {The pandemic has tested the resilience of organizations and consequently hastened the digital acceleration in many organizations. With the Philippine Council for Agriculture, Forestry and Natural Resources Research and Development (DOST-PCAARRD), an e-learning modality was developed to disseminate relevant technologies that have been generated through its various research and development programs and projects. In developing the e-learning platform, the project adopted the ADDIE model of instructional design. This paper describes the process undertaken as PCAARRD transitioned from traditional classroom, face-to-face courses into an e-learning platform, adopting the ADDIE framework of instructional design and using Moodle as a learning management system. It also outlines the challenges and lessons learned from digitization, as well as recommendations and future directions for the program. Following the PCAARRD experience, the ADDIE model was an effective framework to use in e-learning development, primarily based on formative and summative evaluations. The success of e-learning can be considered a factor of various elements, including the learner, resource persons, the training course content, as well as the social interactions and ease of use of technology. The adoption of e-learning as a human capital investment continues to increase, which merits the evaluation of different organizational e-learning programs to introduce new insights or approaches in the delivery of adult learning for agriculture sector research and development.},

            Prediction of learners’ course performance has been a central theme in learning analytics (LA) since the inception of the field. The main motivation for such predictions has been to identify learners who are at risk of low achievement so that they could be offered timely support based on intervention strategies derived from analysis of learners’ data. To predict student success, numerous indicators, from varying data sources, have been examined and reported in the literature. Likewise, a variety of predictive algorithms have been used. The objective of this chapter is to introduce the reader to predictive modelling in LA, through a review of the main objectives, indicators, and algorithms that have been operationalized in previous works as well as a step-by-step tutorial of how to perform predictive modelling in LA using R. The tutorial demonstrates how to predict student success using learning traces originating from a learning management system, guiding the reader through all the required steps from the data preparation all to the evaluation of the built models.},

	abstract = {The future of university learning in Sub-Saharan Africa has become increasingly digitally transformed by both eLearning, and learning analytics, post-COVID-19 pandemic. Learning analytics intervention is critical for effective support of socially-shared regulated learning skills, which are crucial for twenty-first-century e-Learners. Socially-shared regulation is the major determinant of successful collaborative e-learning. However, most e-learners lack such skills thereby facing sociocognitive challenges, due to the unavailability of intelligent support during learning. This research aims to investigate and understand the effect of Learning Analytics instructional support using feedback and prompts, on e-learners’ SSRL indicators. A theoretical model was derived from these factors and built from selected features. Both survey data and behavioral trace data were employed in the Learning analytics-based intervention. In this paper, only a segment of the data is discussed. The e-learners’ perceptions and feedback confirmed that Learning Analytics-based interventions using prompts and feedback are effective in promoting SSRL in collaborative e-learning contexts. The findings indicated that the success of SSRLA-based intervention be tied to support from instructors and academic counselors, particularly feedback on previous problems and quizzes. This will improve e-learners’ SSRL skills for quality educational experience, hence motivate e-learners, and help lecturers to identify at-risk learners in web programming problem-based courses. In conclusion, without adequate utilization of the Learning Analytics interventional trace data, critical information about learners’ behavior patterns in terms of their online interactivity with the course activities and their SSRL profiles and strategies cannot be disclosed leading to little improvement of e-Learning interventions.},

	abstract = {Data analytics provide an important contribution to improving educational processes, as well as managerial and organisational processes in higher education. They are also significant in transforming behavioural, performance, and interaction data on digital learning platforms into pivotal information about the learning process. This chapter presents analysis results from instructional and behavioural formative assessment data for an online common course stored on a Turkish state university’s learning management system using cluster analysis. This chapter focuses on evaluating activity and assessment data to discover student groups as an important input of assessment analytics. Developing supervised models require a priori labels, such as individual student success or fail scores, and a multidimensional dataset identifying relevant performance information gathered during the learning process. In a more realistic setting, the labels are not fully known until the semester end and supervised learning models may then create learning bias when trained only using assessment data. Therefore, cluster analysis presents a promising approach through observing performance similarities between students not yet evaluated for a course or subjected to end-of-term assessment. Although feedback mechanisms were not studied in this chapter, this approach can further help achieve necessary steps to increase student success before a course ends. This study grouped students based on learning performance data using cluster analysis, with models developed and evaluated according to various performance indicators.},

This literature analysis, using directed content analysis, aims to explore the above vacuum. The research questions in this study are: (1) In what ways do the SM as e-Portfolios benefit students in HE? (2) To what extent are the benefits of SM as e-Portfolios comparable to those of conventional e-Portfolios? and (3) What are the drawbacks that practitioners and researchers need to be concerned with? Findings indicate that blogs are the most popular SM used as e-Portfolios to support learning, followed by social networking sites and collaborative projects. The study yields 13 advantages and 12 drawbacks when SM is manipulated as e-Portfolios. These findings conclude that the use of SM as e-Portfolios has a great potential in supporting students’ learning and development by providing an environment for them to learn meaningfully from their experiences and engage in critical reflections and dialogues that allow them to gain new knowledge and valuable insights and thus, improve their skills. A pedagogical framework for the planning and implementation of SM as e-Portfolios is suggested based on the findings and aims of the papers that were reviewed.},

By mapping the identified themes of technological maturity, informing frameworks, affordances, data sources, and analytical levels over publications per year, the review identifies an emerging trajectory towards studentfocused dashboards. These dashboards are informed by theory-oriented frameworks, designed to incorporate affordances that supporting student learning, and realised through integration of more than just activity data from learning management systems – allowing the dashboards to better support students’ learnings processes.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Given the limited presence of students in universities and the closure of educational centers, including nursing schools, during the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been a significant shift toward e-learning. However, there is a lack of research in this area. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the experiences of undergraduate nursing students with e-learning during the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This qualitative-descriptive study focused on 12 undergraduate nursing students from the School of Nursing and Midwifery at Isfahan University of Medical Sciences. The participants were selected using purposive sampling. In-depth and semi-structured interviews were conducted to collect the data. The collected data were analyzed using MAXQDA10 and conventional content analysis. The study was conducted between May and September 2020.
RESULTS: Analysis of the findings led to the emergence of 11 subcategories and two main categories: E-Learning opportunities and Challenges of E-Learning, providing a comprehensive description of the experiences reported by the participants.
CONCLUSIONS: Unforeseen crises, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, can significantly affect the quality of education by disrupting face-to-face learning. To mitigate such disruptions, it is crucial to plan and establish infrastructure that supports alternative modes of education, such as e-learning. Additionally, providing training to students and educators on effectively utilizing digital platforms and producing electronic content can help ensure a smoother transition during crises.},

A total of 513 independent kidneys from our hospital between 2020 and 2022 were randomly allocated to training and validation sets at a 7:3 ratio. Radiomic features were extracted using 3Dslicer software. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method was used to select radiomic features from the 107 extracted features, and logistic regression, decision tree, AdaBoost, and support vector machine (SVM) models were subsequently used to construct radiomic feature prediction models. Among these, the logistic regression algorithm demonstrated the best predictive performance and stability. The area under the curve (AUC) of the logistic regression model based on radiomic features was 0.858 in the training cohort and 0.806 in the validation cohort. Furthermore, univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the independent risk factors for kidney stones, which were gender and body mass index (BMI). Combining these independent risk factors improved the predictive performance of the model, with AUC values of 0.860 in the training cohort and 0.814 in the validation cohort. Clinical decision curve analysis (DCA) indicated that the radiomic model provided clinical benefit when the probability ranged from 0.2 to 1.0. The radiomic model has a good ability to screen high-risk patients with kidney stones, facilitating early intervention in kidney stone cases and improving patient prognosis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Buprenorphine for opioid use disorder (B-MOUD) is essential to improving patient outcomes; however, retention is essential.
OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate machine-learning algorithms predicting retention, overdoses, and all-cause mortality among US military veterans initiating B-MOUD.
METHODS: Veterans initiating B-MOUD from fiscal years 2006-2020 were identified. Veterans' B-MOUD episodes were randomly divided into training (80\%;n = 45,238) and testing samples (20\%;n = 11,309). Candidate algorithms [multiple logistic regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression, random forest (RF), gradient boosting machine (GBM), and deep neural network (DNN)] were used to build and validate classification models to predict six binary outcomes: 1) B-MOUD retention, 2) any overdose, 3) opioid-related overdose, 4) overdose death, 5) opioid overdose death, and 6) all-cause mortality. Model performance was assessed using standard classification statistics [e.g., area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC)].
RESULTS: Episodes in the training sample were 93.0\% male, 78.0\% White, 72.3\% unemployed, and 48.3\% had a concurrent drug use disorder. The GBM model slightly outperformed others in predicting B-MOUD retention (AUC-ROC = 0.72). RF models outperformed others in predicting any overdose (AUC-ROC = 0.77) and opioid overdose (AUC-ROC = 0.77). RF and GBM outperformed other models for overdose death (AUC-ROC = 0.74 for both), and RF and DNN outperformed other models for opioid overdose death (RF AUC-ROC = 0.79; DNN AUC-ROC = 0.78). RF and GBM also outperformed other models for all-cause mortality (AUC-ROC = 0.76 for both). No single predictor accounted for {\textgreater}3\% of the model's variance.
CONCLUSIONS: Machine-learning algorithms can accurately predict OUD-related outcomes with moderate predictive performance; however, prediction of these outcomes is driven by many characteristics.},

Hosted on a Moodle system, the platform housed a structured clinical case as a SCORM file, a usability scale, a certificate of achievement, and a literature library. Optipharm was assessed by 304 medical students from the University of Navarre, Spain, using the SUS-G-Sp scale.
RESULTS: An immersive gamified e-learning tool simulating clinical practice settings was developed, requiring users to assume the role of healthcare professionals in multidisciplinary outpatient consultations. The interface, with a 2D cartoon-style aesthetic, aligns with learning objectives, integrating engaging storytelling and clear instructions for CGA in Phase 1 and pharmacological optimization in Phase 2. The evaluation of Optipharm's usability revealed very positive perceptions among users, with high agreement rates on usability items.
CONCLUSION: Optipharm represents a pioneering gamified tool designed to simulate clinical scenarios, allowing users to engage as healthcare professionals within multidisciplinary teams and address medication-related challenges in older patients with polypharmacy. It provides a secure, interactive learning environment with clear educational objectives and seamless integration of gamification elements, enhancing users' knowledge and skills in managing complex medication regimens. As a platform for experiential learning and knowledge exchange, Optipharm contributes to shaping the future of health education and fostering a culture of patient-centred care among future healthcare professionals.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Medical students gain essential skills through hospital training and internships, which complement their theoretical education. However, virtual patient platforms have been shown to effectively promote clinical reasoning and enhance learning outcomes. This study evaluates a web-based platform designed for learning clinical reasoning in cardiovascular diseases, detailing its functionalities and user satisfaction.
METHODS: The Virtual Patient platform presents medical students with clinically valid scenarios, encompassing stages such as patient description, anamnesis, objective examination, presumptive diagnosis, health investigations, treatment planning, complications, differential and final diagnoses, and prognosis. Scenarios are generated either automatically or manually by professors, based on labeled and annotated clinical data. The Virtual Patient contains two types of medical cases: simple scenarios describing patients with one pathology, and complex scenarios describing patients with several related pathologies. The platform was evaluated by a total of 210 users: 178 medical students, 7 professors, and 25 engineering students, using questionnaires adjusted for each evaluation round to assess satisfaction and gather feedback. The evaluation by medical students was performed in four rounds, each round corresponding to successive enhancements of the platform functionalities and addition of new cases, with a total number of 1,098 evaluation sessions.
RESULTS: The platform was evaluated at different implementation stages, involving simple and complex scenarios for various heart diseases. The majority of students found the platform very useful (82.58\%), with significant appreciation for its features and functionalities, for example the dialogue module supporting natural language interactions in Romanian and English or the feed-back obtained during interaction. Professors highly valued the platform's flexibility in scenario generation, real-time feedback provision, and data management capabilities. They appreciated the possibility to provide feedback and score student performance in real-time or after the session, though some professors suggested improving the explainability of the scores.
CONCLUSIONS: The Virtual Patient platform enables medical students to virtually replicate hospital interactions, diagnose patients, and plan treatments in clinically valid scenarios for cardiovascular diseases. User evaluations demonstrated high satisfaction and appreciation for the platform's features. Future work will focus on expanding medical cases, enhancing the dialogue module, improving scenario generation for complex cases, and extending the synthetic data generation component to produce additional types of medical investigations.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Limited digital literacy is a barrier for vulnerable patients accessing health care.
OBJECTIVE: The Stanford Technology Access Resource Team (START), a service-learning course created to bridge the telehealth digital divide, trained undergraduate and graduate students to provide hands-on patient support to improve access to electronic medical records (EMRs) and video visits while learning about social determinants of health.
METHODS: START students reached out to 1185 patients (n=711, 60\% from primary care clinics of a large academic medical center and n=474, 40\% from a federally qualified health center). Registries consisted of patients without an EMR account (at primary care clinics) or patients with a scheduled telehealth visit (at a federally qualified health center). Patient outcomes were evaluated by successful EMR enrollments and video visit setups. Student outcomes were assessed by reflections coded for thematic content.
RESULTS: Over 6 academic quarters, 57 students reached out to 1185 registry patients. Of the 229 patients contacted, 141 desired technical support. START students successfully established EMR accounts and set up video visits for 78.7\% (111/141) of patients. After program completion, we reached out to 13.5\% (19/141) of patients to collect perspectives on program utility. The majority (18/19, 94.7\%) reported that START students were helpful, and 73.7\% (14/19) reported that they had successfully connected with their health care provider in a digital visit. Inability to establish access included a lack of Wi-Fi or device access, the absence of an interpreter, and a disability that precluded the use of video visits. Qualitative analysis of student reflections showed an impact on future career goals and improved awareness of health disparities of technology access.
CONCLUSIONS: Of the patients who desired telehealth access, START improved access for 78.7\% (111/141) of patients. Students found that START broadened their understanding of health disparities and social determinants of health and influenced their future career goals.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Practicing mindfulness is a mental process toward interoceptive awareness, achieving stress reduction and emotion regulation through brain-function alteration. Literature has shown that electroencephalography (EEG)-derived connectivity possesses the potential to differentiate brain functions between mindfulness naïve and mindfulness experienced, where such quantitative differentiation could benefit telediagnosis for mental health. However, there is no prior guidance in model selection targeting on the mindfulness-experience prediction. Here we hypothesized that the EEG effective connectivity could reach a good prediction performance in mindfulness experiences with brain interpretability.
METHODS: We aimed at probing direct Directed Transfer Function (dDTF) to classify the participants' history of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), and aimed at optimizing the prediction accuracy by comparing multiple machine learning (ML) algorithms. Targeting the gamma-band effective connectivity, we evaluated the EEG-based prediction of the mindfulness experiences across 7 machine learning (ML) algorithms and 3 sessions (i.e., resting, focus-breathing, and body-scan).
RESULTS: The support vector machine and naïve Bayes classifiers exhibited significant accuracies above the chance level across all three sessions, and the decision tree algorithm reached the highest prediction accuracy of 91.7 \% with the resting state, compared to the classification accuracies with the other two mindful states. We further conducted the analysis on essential EEG channels to preserve the classification accuracy, revealing that preserving just four channels (F7, F8, T7, and P7) out of 19 yielded the accuracy of 83.3 \%. Delving into the contribution of connectivity features, specific connectivity features predominantly located in the frontal lobe contributed more to classifier construction, which aligned well with the existing mindfulness literature.
CONCLUSION: In the present study, we initiated a milestone of developing an EEG-based classifier to detect a person's mindfulness experience objectively. The prediction accuracy of the decision tree was optimal to differentiate the mindfulness experiences using the local resting-state EEG data. The suggested algorithm and key channels on the mindfulness-experience prediction may provide guidance for predicting mindfulness experiences using the EEG-based classification embedded in future wearable neurofeedback systems or plausible digital therapeutics.},

	abstract = {In an era of rapid digital development, e-learning has become a significant trend in the educational field. Medical technology students need to acquire extensive theoretical knowledge and practical skills. E-learning can enhance learning experiences, improving students' understanding and application abilities. This study examined the impact of learning motivation, learning approaches, and learning burnout on the academic performance of medical technology students in an e-learning environment. This study conducted a quantitative survey on 37 medical technology students. The questionnaires included learning motivations, learning methods, and burnout, and responses provided on a 5-point Likert scale. First, the 37 students were categorized into three groups based on their academic performance. Then, differences between these groups were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test, and correlations between academic performance and questionnaire variables were calculated using Spearman correlation analysis. It revealed that motivation varies among different academic performance levels. Furthermore, in the high-grade group, self-efficacy (r = -0.502, p = 0.047), monitoring studying (r = 0.494, p = 0.032), and emotional exhaustion (r = 0.514, p = 0.024) were correlated to academic performance. In the middle-grade group, self-efficacy for learning and performance was correlated to academic performance (r = 0.858, p = 0.001). In the low-grade group, academic performance was correlated to depth approach (r = 0.826, p = 0.022) and organized studying (r = 0.833, p = 0.020). This study, through a quantitative survey, found significant differences in learning motivation, learning methods, and learning burnout among medical technology students with different academic performance levels. High-grade students demonstrated higher levels of emotional exhaustion, which may reflect feelings of overextension and academic burnout in e-learning environments; the academic performance of the middle-grade group was related to intrinsic motivation; and low-grade students showed a stronger correlation between their learning methods in e-learning and their academic performance. These insights underscore the necessity for personalized learning strategies to enhance educational outcomes effectively.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mental disorders pose a major public health problem in most western countries. The demand for services for common mental health disorders has been on the rise despite the widespread accessibility of medication. Especially, the supply and demand for evidence-based psychotherapy do not align. Large-scale increase of modern psychotherapy is difficult with current methods of training which are often expensive, time consuming, and dependent on a small number of top-level professionals as trainers. E-learning has been proposed to enhance psychotherapy training accessibility, quality, and scalability.
OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aims to provide an overview of the current evidence regarding e-learning in psychotherapy training. In particular, the review examines the usability, acceptability, and learning outcomes associated with e-learning. Learning outcomes are assessed in different modalities including trainee experiences, knowledge acquisition, skill acquisition, and application of trained content in daily practice. Furthermore, the equivalence of web-based training and conventional training methods is evaluated.
METHODS: Following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, a search from Ovid, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Scopus databases between 2008 and June 2022 was conducted. Inclusion criteria required studies to describe e-learning systems for psychotherapy training and assess acceptability, feasibility, or learning outcomes. The risk of bias was evaluated for both randomized and nonrandomized studies. Learning outcomes were categorized using the Kirkpatrick model. Effect sizes comparing e-learning and traditional methods were calculated.
RESULTS: The search yielded 3380 publications, of which 34 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Positive learning outcomes are generally associated with various e-learning programs in psychotherapy training including trainee satisfaction, knowledge, and skill acquisition, and in application of trained content in clinical practice. Learning outcomes generally show equivalence between e-learning and conventional training methods. The overall effect size, indicating this disparity, was 0.01, suggesting no significant difference. This literature displays a high level of heterogeneity in e-learning solutions and assessment methods.
CONCLUSIONS: e-Learning seems to have good potential to enhance psychotherapy training by increasing access, scalability, and cost-effectiveness while maintaining quality in terms of learning outcomes. Results are congruent with findings related to e-learning in health education in general where e-learning as a pedagogy is linked to an opportunity to carry out learner-centric practices. Recommendations for conducting psychotherapy training programs in blended settings supported by activating learning methods are presented. However, due to the heterogeneity and limitations in the existing literature, further research is necessary to replicate these findings and to establish global standards for e-learning, as well as for the assessment of training outcomes in psychotherapy education. Research is especially needed on the effects of training on patient outcomes and optimal ways to combine e-learning and conventional training methods in blended learning settings.},

As in the field of biochemistry, in which concepts are complex and procedures are integral to the information, e-learning has its advantages and drawbacks. This study was designed with the intention to examine the suitability of e-learning model in the context of biochemistry course, more specifically, it was to identify the extent to which digital learning environment supports students' understanding and real-life use of biochemical knowledge. Quantitative research comprises of the use of Survivors to obtain numerical data concerning the success of e-learning platforms concerning biochemistry. A survey is designed to have closed questions (such as the Likert scale) as well as demographic questions to capture. Closed questions measure participants' views on e-learning tools, its utility and instructional usefulness as well as the demographic questions, which give a précis of participant profile and their past experiences in e-learning. The learning objectives laid down for the course were specific, measurable, and generic and included topics, such as enzyme kinetics, metabolic pathways, and protein structures. These were grouped into topic-based weekly work schedule. These sessions revealed that students who were attending the biochemistry courses are different, in that 71\% of them agreed that the learning objectives for each of the modules, which were at the start of the course, served as a useful guide for understanding biochemistry as the learning objectives were well outlined at the start of the course. In about and through all of these recommendations, educational institutions will be able to design a more responsive and fair-blended e-learning environment that fosters success among learners and advanced understanding of biochemistry.},

We are experiencing transformative practices being applied to meet the societal and technological changes. We offer a revised scenario outlining the steps for developing academic writing skills with highlighted affordances of technology in undergraduate students of Management of Tourism. The psychodidactic approach is applied in assisting students in the scientiﬁc processing of a heritage tourism topic in individual stages, from establishing existing knowledge to own contribution in the form of literary research. It forms a frame within which a set of activities is conducted in blended learning environment. The presented exploratory study employs a mixed-methods approach encompassing frequency analysis followed by thematic analysis, comparison of ﬁndings, and survey. Individual steps in the didactic scenario are described and ﬁndings are visualized. Experience of students with utilization of bibliographic databases is highlighted. Simple-seeming exercises had to be inserted into the scenario because the students had no prior experience with AI-powered technologies like Chat GPT or Copilot. For academic writing, no one employed any writing assistant, yet the majority could use bibliographic databases and cite sources quite well.},

	abstract = {In the landscape of higher education, a significant portion of student learning occurs within digital environments, facilitated by interconnected networks such as Learning Management Systems (LMS), Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), and various online platforms. This digital landscape generates a vast repository of educational data, offering valuable insights for educational stakeholders. However, evaluating student engagement in online learning presents a critical challenge. This study addresses this challenge by focusing on the evaluation of student engagement using Learning Analytics (LA). We introduce DDS-Eng, a Data-Driven Decision Support System designed to analyze students’ engagement. Our approach involves thorough requirement analysis to define decision-makers’ needs and selected data sources, followed by the development of a multidimensional model capturing engagement aspects and associated metrics. We then implement a dedicated interface utilizing Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) queries and a Learning Analytics Dashboard (LAD) to analyze individual student behavior and overall student engagement comprehensively. Finally, we present an empirical evaluation of our LAD conducted in a controlled environment. This research underscores the importance of student engagement in online learning and emphasizes the need for innovative approaches to evaluate learner engagement in multimodal and informal learning environments.},

	abstract = {Learning analytics leverages the use of technology to gather and analyse data about student performance, engagement, and learning behaviours, which can help educators make informed decisions about how to improve learning outcomes. In higher education, learning analytics can provide insights into student engagement, performance, and learning pathways. Collaborative learning in higher education involves a group of students working together towards a common goal or task. Collaborative learning encourages students to work together to solve problems, analyse information, and make decisions, especially in self-directed learning environment. Through discussion and debate, students develop critical thinking skills and learn to approach problems from different perspectives to enhance problem-solving skills. Collaborative learning provides opportunities for students to work with others from diverse backgrounds, helping them develop interpersonal skills such as communication, teamwork, and leadership. While collaborative learning helps students to foster critical thinking and develop interpersonal skills, students’ activities and engagement in collaborative learning are not properly assessed and measured. Student performance indicators are highly dependent on the learning activities and resources used in the learning management system based on individual basis. The ability and potential of learning analytics to track students’ behaviour and performance in team, and to monitor the effectiveness of their sharing and communication is not fully utilised in higher education. This paper addresses this issue and aims to provide an overview of collaborative learning analytics. The overview elaborates essential elements in collaborative learning and defines features in analytics to support collaborative learning. The overview is expected to guide to educators and developers in promoting and assessing students’ performance based on collaborative works.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study is to present data on the use of learning analytics in the field of education. For this purpose, data available in the Web of Science database were examined using bibliometric analysis. The publication distribution varied between 2011 and 2022, with the number of publications reaching its peak in 2020 and declining thereafter. Findings from co-authorship analysis indicate that Dragan Gašević is the most prolific author and the most cited researcher in the field of learning analytics. Results of co-authorship analysis by country suggest that researchers affiliated with institutions in Australia engage in more collaborative work and cooperation. Results of co-authorship analysis by organizations demonstrate that Monash University in Australia is the organization with the highest level of collaboration with other organizations. The most cited work is Ferguson's (2012) article titled "Learning analytics: drivers, developments and challenges." The most frequently used keywords in conjunction with learning analytics are higher education, educational data mining, online learning, learning design, and self-regulated learning. In recent years, there has been a focus on learning analytics related to learning management systems (LMS) rather than MOOCs in learning environments. The British Journal of Educational Technology, which was established in 1970, is the most cited journal that is commonly referenced in the articles. It is hoped that this study will serve as a valuable reference for researchers interested in the field and guide them in making accurate inferences based on a broad perspective.},

We discuss the appropriate educational scenario, which combines multimedia content, interaction between the collaborative group, and active learning elements, and then we model this scenario with the UML modeling language. As a result, we represent how the design of educational scenarios, provides a better enhancement of the collaborative learning experience through the use of new technologies so that learners are encouraged to reflect on their learning processes and their group's collaboration, thus promoting better understanding. In conclusion, designing and modeling a collaborative learning educational scenario emphasizes collaboration, interaction, and knowledge acquisition between learners within a collaborative learning activity.},

This qualitative case study addresses this gap by examining the experiences of an EFL teacher educator and her 16 students during a twelve-week enacting dialogic pedagogy mediated by Microsoft Teams (MT). Utilizing thematic analysis from thirteen video recordings, four discussion forums, three series of teacher interviews, student feedback, and researchers' observations, the study revealed that the classroom dialogue was facilitated in MT by structuring the online environment, enhancing synchronous video conferencing through ‘meet now,’ extending dialogue through chat-based learning in ‘channel,’ and enriching interaction with multimodal cues. The study suggests that while digital technologies can enhance dialogic activities, it is crucial for teachers and students to enhance and maintain their dialogic stance and digital competence in online classrooms.},

High learner expectations of teachers’ competence seem to have a positive effect on learners themselves, e.g., on motivation and performance. Little is known about the effects of learners’ expectation on teachers’ experience and behavior. In this field study, the relationship between university students’ initial competence expectations of lecturers on their experience during and evaluation of a course session was explored for both students (N = 871 responses; multiple participations possible) and lecturers (N = 41). Multilevel analyses (controlling for students’ initial warmth and attractiveness perceptions of lecturers) showed that students’ competence expectations of their lecturers were positively related to their motivation (interest and boredom) and negatively related to their perceptions of disruptions. The relationship between students’ competence expectations and lecturers’ experience was more unsystematic: positive correlations were found with the rating of the lecturers’ own positive emotions and their feelings of competence, and a negative correlation was found with their disruption mismanagement. In summary, students’ expectations of lecturers seem to be relevant in a teaching-learning context, even though mostly small effect sizes could be shown.},

Therefore, this work aimed to compare the performance of students in the histology discipline, when compared to traditional teaching methodology and its association with game-based learning and a basic histology teaching platform. Three classes of the medical course were selected between the years 2022 and 2023, each of which was separated into a group. One group did not have access to any platform, being called the Traditional Group (TG), a group that used Kahoot!, being called the Kahoot Group (KG), and a group that used the teaching platform, being called the Histoatlas Group (HG). Both KG and HG groups showed greater effectiveness in learning and improved performance, when compared to TG. These improvements in KG and HG were also highlighted as learning aids and easy to use. KG students performed better in the practical test when comparing groups. However, this difference was not observed in the students' averages. However, students pointed out the relevance of trying to improve the traditional teaching methodology. Therefore, this study points out that, even though the traditional teaching methodology is efficient in the student's teaching and learning process, there is a need on the part of students to make the subject more dynamic.},

	abstract = {Die Transformation unserer Lebens- und Arbeitswelt in eine sog. „Kultur der Digitalität“ beschreibt den Übergang einer Welt in eine Kultur, in welcher nicht nur das Einbinden von Machine Learning (z.B. in Form von generativen künstlichen Intelligenzen), sondern vor allem das disziplinübergreifende und selbstverantwortliche Vernetzen und Interagieren von Fachkräften eine zentrale Rolle einnehmen. Zur Vermittlung solcher Kompetenzen an beruflichen Schulen empfiehlt sich das Design Thinking Konzept als Lehr-Lernansatz, welches wiederum bereits in der Lehrkräftebildung an der BUW im Sinne einer fachgerechten Konzeption von Open Educational Resources von den Autoren in einer universitären Lehrveranstaltung für berufliche Fachrichtungen erprobt wurde und den Kontext der folgenden Ausarbeitungen bildet. Im Rahmen der Hochschultage Berufliche Bildung im März 2023 haben die Autoren (Veranstalter der Fachtagung „Mediendesign u. Medientechnik“) dementsprechend zunächst in Form von drei Fachvorträgen die Begriffe und Bezugsgrößen der „Kultur der Digitalität“, des „Design Thinking“ als Lehr-Lernansatz sowie der erziehungswissenschaftlich-allgemeindidaktischen Reflexionen zu Open Educational Resources (vor dem Hintergrund einer zukunftsorientierten Qualifizierung von Bildungspersonal) in einen zielgerichteten Sinnzusammenhang gesetzt, um im Anschluss einen praxiszentrierten Workshop zur methodengerechten und kreativen Konzeption von Open Educational Resources anzuleiten.},

Using a quantitative approach and a comprehensive questionnaire based on recent work by the Australasian Council on Open, Distance, and e-Learning (as reported by ACODE, Survey of micro-credentialing practice in Australasian universities 2021: An ACODE Whitepaper—October 2021, 2021), the study investigates areas such as standards, policies, adoption rates, integration into the curriculum, credentialing engines, and professional development. The findings indicate that micro-credentialing is still in its early stages in the region, with most universities initiating micro-credentialing within the past four years. The lack of a favorable policy ecosystem and standards for learning design, content, delivery, assessment, sizing, and issuance are identified as significant hindrances to the adoption of micro-credentials. To advance the micro-credential market, the study recommends that stakeholders collaborate and create quality standards, accountability mechanisms, financing strategies, and documentation frameworks that promote interoperability. The study suggests that improving policies for micro-credentials could help legitimize them and promote a more unified vision of microcredentials as a crucial component of the national educational strategy.},

	abstract = {Introduction
              In the dynamic landscape of education, the fusion of technology and learning, commonly termed “technology-enhanced learning” (TEL), has emerged as a transformative phenomenon. This study focuses on the imperative integration of TEL in medical education, recognizing the diverse digital literacy levels of adult learners. The exploration introduces the innovative E-Portal training program, designed to empower health professions educators with essential skills for proficiently employing digital tools in instruction.
            
            
              Methodology
              A dedicated team of medical educationists conducted a thorough investigation into E-curriculum design and delivery, employing the Moodle Learning Management System as the foundation for the E-Portal training program. The training, spanning crucial stages such as course design, content delivery, self-paced teaching, and quality assessment, facilitated participant progression at individual paces, unlocking subsequent steps upon meeting stipulated prerequisites. A pre-training questionnaire gauged participants’ comprehension of distance learning, e-learning, synchronous and asynchronous teaching, and self-directed study. Subsequent focus group discussion post-training generated rich insights into participants’ experiences, reflections, and identified challenges.
            
            
              Results
              The results illuminate participants’ limited adeptness with e-learning terminology, successful assimilation of components and functionalities, and heightened confidence in online teaching practices. However, discerned challenges during implementation, such as technical hurdles and engagement issues, highlight the multifaceted nature of TEL integration. While the E-Portal training positively impacted preparedness, participant feedback advocates for improvements in assessment tools, technical training provisions, and exploration of alternative Learning Management Systems.
            
            
              Discussion and conclusion
              Study emphasizes the ongoing need for diverse training methodologies across Learning Management Systems, acknowledging the evolving nature of education and technology. This study underscores the transformative role of a tailored E-Portal training program in seamlessly integrating digital tools into medical education. The comprehensive insights provided contribute to a nuanced understanding of the advantages, obstacles, and potential avenues for enhancement in curriculum delivery through technology-enhanced learning, thereby propelling the field forward.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has presented unique challenges for developing countries, necessitating innovative and adaptive strategies for effective management. This chapter delves into the multifaceted aspects of COVID-19 management in these regions. Developing countries, often characterized by limited healthcare resources and socio-economic vulnerabilities, have faced an uphill battle in the ﬁght against COVID-19. However, amidst these challenges lie opportunities for creative and impactful solutions. This chapter provides a condensed overview of the key recommendations to enhance COVID-19 management in developing countries. A critical element is the imperative to strengthen healthcare infrastructure. Increasing hospital capacity, healthcare workforce training, and the supply of medical essentials like ventilators and personal protective equipment are essential steps. Additionally, harnessing telemedicine and telehealth services can alleviate the burden on healthcare facilities, ensuring that patients continue to receive quality care while minimizing the risk of viral transmission. Expanding testing and vaccination efforts is another pivotal strategy. Accessibility to testing, contact tracing, and the equitable distribution of vaccines are vital components of this approach. Community engagement and public health campaigns play a fundamental role in dispelling vaccine hesitancy and misinformation. To ensure long-term resilience, a holistic approach is necessary. This includes addressing mental health support, economic vulnerabilities, and education continuity. The pandemic’s toll on mental health requires teletherapy services and community support groups. Economic safety nets, food security measures, and targeted ﬁnancial assistance are essential to alleviate the economic burden on vulnerable populations. For education, a blend of e-learning platforms, local partnerships, and innovative ﬁnancing mechanisms can help ensure that students’ educational needs are met. International collaboration is critical in the global ﬁght against COVID-19. Developing countries should leverage partnerships with international organizations, neighboring countries, and private sector entities to secure resources, expertise, and vaccines. Collaboration with local leaders, inﬂuencers, and healthcare workers enhances the effectiveness of public health campaigns. Lastly, continuous monitoring and adaptability are essential components of effective COVID-19 management. Regular assessment, data-driven decisionmaking, and a focus on research and local solutions contribute to a dynamic response that can evolve with the pandemic. In conclusion, managing COVID-19 in developing countries requires a comprehensive, adaptable, and collaborative approach that addresses healthcare, economic, and socio-cultural factors. By implementing these recommendations tailored to local contexts, developing countries can strengthen their resilience in the face of the ongoing pandemic and future health crises.},

Among the program’s aims is to determine the ablest interns and connect them with top employers in a merit-based system. Hence, all applying interns are put through an assessment procedure that determines their level of competence and capability. To be able to develop such a system, the program is designed in three meso-cycles following educational design research, and the assessment procedure of the program is based on assessment analytics. By studying the development cycles of the program, this study aims to achieve three goals: (1) how can assessment analytics be effectively utilized for the purpose of summative assessment, (2) how can assessment analytics be applied within a nationwide scale, and (3) how assessment analytics can be applied in experiential learning contexts. For these aims, the study focuses on the practices for the management of the talent pool of NIP to investigate how data-driven decision-making was supported and competence-based application evaluation was assured. These practices and the program overall were evaluated using satisfaction surveys filled by both students and employers that participated in NIP, and the findings indicated great satisfaction from both parties towards the measurement method, the reliability of the measurement, and the usability of the system.},

	abstract = {Burnout among medical and health sciences students in developing countries is a critical concern with far-reaching implications for both individual well-being and the healthcare systems they will eventually join. This chapter explores the prevalence, contributing factors, prevention strategies, and management approaches related to burnout in this speciﬁc student population. In developing countries, students face unique challenges such as resource constraints, limited access to modern educational facilities, socioeconomic pressures, and cultural expectations. These factors intensify the risk of burnout, making it imperative to adopt tailored strategies for prevention and management. Recommendations include resource allocation, ﬁnancial support, curriculum adaptation, mental health services, early identiﬁcation, faculty and peer support, ﬂexibility in learning, and community engagement. Furthermore, fostering a culture of empathy, resilience, and self-care within healthcare education is essential. By implementing these recommendations, stakeholders can protect student wellbeing and contribute to the development of a resilient, compassionate, and highly skilled healthcare workforce. This, in turn, can enhance the quality of healthcare services and patient outcomes while addressing the unique challenges faced in developing countries.},

	abstract = {Background  In recent years, the subspecialty of neuropalliative care has emerged with the goal of improving the quality of life of patients suffering from neurological disease, though gaps remain in neuropalliative care education and training. E-learning has been described as a way to deliver interactive and facilitated lower-cost learning to address global gaps in medical care. We describe here the development of a novel, international, hybrid, and asynchronous curriculum with both self-paced modules and class-based lectures on neuropalliative care topics designed for the neurologist interested in palliative care, the palliative care physician interested in caring for neurological patients, and any other physician or advanced care providers interested in neuropalliative care. Methods  The course consisted of 12 modules, one per every four weeks, beginning July 2022. Each module is based on a case and relevant topics. Course content was divided into three streams (Neurology Basics, Palliative Care Basics, and Neuropalliative Care Essentials) of which two were optional and one was mandatory, and consisted of classroom sessions, webinars, and an in-person skills session. Evaluation of learners consisted of multiple choice questions and written assignments for each module. Evaluation of the course was based on semi-structured qualitative interviews conducted with both educator and learner, the latter of which will be published separately. Audio files were transcribed and underwent thematic analysis. For the discussion of the results, Khan’s e-learning framework was used. Results  Ten of the 12 participating educators were interviewed. Of the educators, three identified as mid-career and seven as senior faculty, ranging from six to 33 years of experience. Nine of ten reported an academic affiliation and all reported association with a teaching hospital. Themes identified from the educators’ evaluations were: bridging the global gap, getting everybody on board, defining the educational scope, investing extensive hours of voluntary time and resources, benefiting within and beyond the curriculum, understanding the learner’s experience, creating a community of shared learning, adapting future teaching and learning strategies, and envisioning long term sustainability.},

The greatest aspect of offering online quizzes is that the correct answer and any suitable comments are offered to students instantly after they complete a question. The present study evaluates students’ overall performance in one of the core courses, in which self-assessment quizzes were administered through the e-learning system in order to reflect their learning behaviour towards the coursework. As part of formative assessment, it was noted that students’ frequent efforts aggregated during the final exam session; yet, as soon as the quizzes were made available, a few students took them. The data demonstrated a substantial link between students who took the quizzes and their overall achievement as measured by final grades. This paper delves through the essential factors to consider when developing well-crafted quizzes for technical courses and so maximising their potential as an effective learning tool.},

The results showed that motivational variables were associated with students’ social presence and online self-regulation, which in turn related to their cognitive presence and empowerment in the online learning environment. Growth mindset and self-efficacy also exhibited a significant correlation with students’ cognitive presence. There was a positive correlation between cognitive presence and empowerment. We also found teaching presence has a positive association with social presence but a negative association with online self-regulation.

              Despite the significance of self-regulated learning as an important educational goal, teachers face difficulties in fostering students’ skills in self-regulated learning (SRL). Teachers exhibit variability in their capacity to foster SRL. There is no guarantee that students consistently benefit from their teachers’ promotion of SRL. This study aims to address this issue by examining (1) how teachers promote SRL, (2) the relationship between teachers’ professional competences and their promotion of SRL, and (3) the association between teachers’ promotion of SRL and students’ SRL. Data from
              N
               = 54 teachers and their
              N
               = 823 lower secondary school students were analysed using online questionnaires, knowledge tests, and video recordings. The analysed video data reveals that teachers foster SRL predominantly implicitly, invest most of the time in promoting metacognitive strategies and primarily design learning environments that foster student support. Overall, only a few significant correlations were found between teachers’ professional competences and their promotion of SRL. Further, the results indicate no clear correlation pattern between teachers’ promotion and students’ skills in SRL. Further research should shed more light on the relationship between teachers’ promotion of SRL and students’ SRL to better understand whether and how they might be related.

            Zusammenfassung
            
              Trotz der Bedeutung des selbstregulierten Lernens (SRL) als wichtiges Bildungsziel, haben Lehrkräfte Schwierigkeiten, die Fähigkeiten der Schüler:innen zum SRL zu fördern. Lehrkräfte zeigen unterschiedliche Fähigkeiten, selbstreguliertes Lernen zu fördern. Es ist nicht garantiert, dass Schüler:innen von der Förderung des selbstregulierten Lernens durch ihre Lehrkräfte profitieren. Daher untersucht diese Studie (1) wie Lehrkräfte SRL fördern, (2) die Beziehung zwischen den professionellen Kompetenzen der Lehrkräfte und ihrer Förderung des SRL und (3) den Zusammenhang zwischen der Förderung des SRL durch die Lehrkräfte und dem SRL der Schüler:innen. Die Daten von
              N
               = 54 Lehrkräften und ihren
              N
               = 823 Schüler:innen der Sekundarstufe I wurden anhand von Online-Fragebögen, Wissenstests und Videoaufnahmen analysiert. Die analysierten Videodaten zeigen, dass die Lehrkräfte das SRL überwiegend implizit fördern, die meiste Zeit in die Förderung metakognitiver Strategien investieren und primär Lernumgebungen gestalten, die die Schüler:innen unterstützen. Insgesamt wurden nur wenige signifikante Korrelationen zwischen den professionellen Kompetenzen der Lehrkräfte und ihrer Förderung des SRL gefunden. Darüber hinaus zeigen die Ergebnisse kein klares Korrelationsmuster zwischen der Förderung der Lehrkräfte und dem SRL der Schüler:innen. Weitere Untersuchungen sollten die Beziehung zwischen der Förderung des SRL durch die Lehrkräfte und dem SRL der Schüler:innen genauer beleuchten, um besser zu verstehen ob und wie diese zusammenhängen könnten.},

	abstract = {The use of virtual reality and 360° videos has been little researched so far, especially in social work studies and teaching. The reasons for this are the low prevalence of VR headsets in social work courses and the fundamental technological deficit in social work, which means the lack of clear causal chains within it. Professionals must adapt their practical knowledge to the individual framework conditions and problem situations depending on the case situation and field of work. In contrast, in simulation-based approaches, as used in the teaching of many rather object-oriented courses of study, fixed sequences of action usually lead to success. At the same time, 360° videos, with suitable didactic framing, can be used to convey case studies in an immersive manner that can then be continued individually, methodically developed and reflected upon. In the” Teilprojekt XR”, two approaches to the use of VR headsets were designed, the first enables remote collaboration, the second offers a chance for analysis and reflection using 360° videos. The first approach is Collaborative work using VR headsets, which is intended to be an addition to communication with existing video conferencing systems. It has the potential to counteract the previous challenges associated with zoom technology and create more proximity. The first few evaluation results (n=11) on the methodological implementation of collaborative work with VR headsets suggest that this approach can bring added value to students. However, getting started with VR headsets is challenging for students and only a few have taken up the offer so far. The integration of 360° videos in education has potential for social work, as the high degree of realism and immersion can improve the link between theory and practice. Students can thus obtain realistic insights into practical examples already during their studies and professionally reflect on their own perspective in the situations. The use of 360° videos using VR headsets has been tested and established in teaching in four seminars so far. The students experience the simulated case situations from the subjective perspective of the different protagonists and can thus more easily put themselves in their individual perspective. Didactically, these observations are professionally framed by teaching content taught in advance, group work in small numbers as well as a collaborative analysis and reflection within the seminar group. The results of the evaluation (n=60) of the integration of 360° videos into teaching are promising and show a clear potential for university didactics. A flow experience and an experience of presence were confirmed by the students when working with the 360° videos. Furthermore, the students reported that the methodological extension supported their comprehension of the course materials and validate the usefulness and advantages of using 360° videos during the seminars.},

For example, the forum or discussion board is widely used, and an emerging functionality, danmaku, which enables messages to be synchronized with video playback, has also been utilized recently. To explore how mass participation is accommodated and what categories of interaction learners implement, this study utilizes analysis of interaction and manual content analysis through learner-generated text data from two specific tools employed in a massive open online course (MOOC) setting: the discussion board (N = 739) and danmaku (N = 2435). Results of the analysis of interaction indicate that mass participation is managed differently by the tools: danmaku fosters a collective space for massive participants, while the discussion board organizes them into threaded small groups. In addition, results of the content analysis show danmaku primarily supports indirect interaction with a focus on the socio-emotional dimension, while the discussion board serves as a platform for direct discussions, particularly in the cognitive dimension. Furthermore, within the context of large-scale engagement, various levels of joint interaction, in addition to collaboration, are discerned and discussed in both socio-emotional and cognitive interactions. The findings offer insights for developing sociable and scalable socio-technical environments in computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL), addressing emerging educational trends. Practical implications for educational design based on these findings are also discussed.},

Concerning AI-supported self-study, however, higher education first needs to answer the question of what role teachers can and should play in these scenarios. Using the “HAnS” intelligent assistance system for higher education as a case study, this paper discusses how AI can affect the distribution of roles in self-study from the teacher perspective. To this end, I present the results of two explorative studies and discuss what teachers identify as AI’s potential and barriers to self-regulated learning and student participation.},

	abstract = {During the COVID pandemic, it became clear that understanding assessment in terms of cognitive processes has plenty of limitations. The emerging artiﬁcial intelligence technologies (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot, Perplexity) made it even more apparent, bringing more ethical dilemmas and showing more weaknesses in the higher educational systems. Online education is a new reality, and academic staff should rethink how they approach teaching, assessment, and learning in the digital environment. We can no longer respond to new educational challenges with the same traditional approaches and mindsets. In post-pandemic higher education, besides focusing on ethical dilemmas and cognitive processes, it would be worth reﬂecting on the impact of personal and social implications of what learners are learning, their feelings, interests, and values, and ways to empower students to become more selfdirected learners. Based on Fink’s taxonomy of signiﬁcant learning, this chapter will provide an integrative framework of digital assessment techniques to stimulate student motivation and academic performance. Our conceptual work will bring empirical evidence to facilitate the successful implementation and integration of digital assessment in higher education, emphasizing the human dimension of higher education.},

It examined their roles in boosting the Higher-Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) and problem-solving abilities of students. The study adopted a qualitative approach and a research design based on a phenomenological approach involving semi-structured interviews with 22 educators of different ages, backgrounds, and experiences from STCs in various cities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The data were analysed following a sixstep thematic process, identifying effectiveness, challenges, and areas for improvement. Our ﬁndings indicate that digital assessment tools can enhance learning skills, improve students’ understanding of physics, critical thinking, analytical skills, and engagement and application of theory. The challenges include technical problems and the need for more training and guidance. The study suggests solutions, such as improved training and customisation of tools. Despite its positive outcomes, the study notes its limited generalisability and potential bias. It calls for further research, including quantitative and longitudinal studies, to assess the long-term effects of these tools on physics education. In summary, the study highlights the value of DATs to advance physics education and improve HOTS and problem-solving skills.},

Given educators understandable trepidation, we decided to embrace, accentuate the positive and ‘lean-in’ to ChatGPT. In this study, we explore an assessment case study and share how an assessment adaptation within an entrepreneurship module offers educators and students alike an opportunity to embrace ChatGPT and to learn from the potential that ChatGPT can bring to the classroom. Such an approach offers a constructive strategy by considering students as collaborators in the AI educational experience. We present the challenges for educators, followed by a discussion on the strategies educators can use to embrace AI. Finally, while acknowledging the ever-evolving educational landscape, we acknowledge the educator’s role in emphasising the role of authentic assessment, thus helping to develop students’ digital literacy, critical thinking and problem-solving skills, regardless of programme of study.},

The success of online discussion forums depends largely on the e-moderating behavior of the students who are assigned the role of peer moderators. Their ability to facilitate meaningful discussions, encourage diverse perspectives, and keep the conversation on track is paramount to achieving group cognitive engagement and superior performance. This study analyzed the discourse generated by learners in online discussion forums, with a particular focus on the still under-explored eﬀort of peer moderation on groups’ cognitive engagement and learning achievement in online discussion forums. The result of multiple regression analyzes demonstrates how certain levels of cognitive engagement and peer moderation relate to learning achievement. Furthermore, this study examined the moderating role of peer moderation in the association between high-order cognitive engagement and learning achievement. The ﬁndings indicate that while peer moderation can have a positive moderating eﬀect, this eﬀect is weaker for a higher number of Development moderations, suggesting that excessive Development may lead to endless arguments and decrease discussion eﬃciency.},

	abstract = {Effective video resources are assumed to promote learner engagement, but the extent to which this occurs is unclear. This study examines learners' engagement with instructor-generated video. It contributes an analytical synthesis of qualitative and quantitative data that provides the basis for investigating the extent to which, and how, learners engage with video resources provided in their courses. Specifically, three dimensions of learner engagement with video are studied: behavioural, cognitive and affective. The study contributes to educational technology research by identifying distinctive patterns of learner control over the use of video which diverges from instructors' assumptions. It shows the complex and nuanced features of cognitive and affective engagement. Videos can have positive effects, but inappropriate use of technical features results in learner disengagement. This study contributes a novel use of signalling theory, suggesting the importance of instructor signals concerning relevance, focus and utility as a feature of video generation, as a prerequisite of cognitive engagement. A research and theory development agenda is developed, locating video-based learning in student contexts as a basis for explaining both engagement and disengagement with video technology affordances. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Higher education tutors are increasingly expected to generate video content as a feature of their course delivery. Although effective video resources are assumed to promote learner engagement, the extent to which this occurs is unclear. Video technology affordances rarely feature in academic professional development programmes leaving tutors ill-equipped to understand how and in what ways students engage with video resources as a part of their courses. What this paper adds A novel use of signalling theory to explain different patterns of learner engagement and disengagement. Learner agency and control results in video technology affordances being fitted and ‘flexed’ around factors that instructors rarely consider in the video generation process. A new model to describe factors that affect student engagement with instructor-generated video. Implications for practice and/or policy Raise awareness for instructors about patterns of student engagement with video technology affordances that affect learning experience and outcomes. Implement professional development programmes to equip instructors to design and generate video content that takes account of patterns of behavioural, cognitive and affective engagement and signals relevance, focus and utility. Develop clear policies regarding technical features of video generation to avoid learner disengagement.},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of technology, learning environments and the features expected from learners are changing. In the digital age, where constructivist learning systems are based, learners are expected to be active in learning environments. Active participation of students in the learning process also improves their thinking skills. Computational thinking (CT), one of these skills, focuses on utilizing digital technologies in problem-solving processes. Design-based learning (DBL) environments are very important in developing this skill. Design-based learning environments also focus on solving real-world problems and mostly use technology. Knowing the characteristics of DBL environments and planning and applying the processes accordingly will help to achieve successful results. DBL is preferred when centering the learners in the learning processes. When the literature is examined, CT and DBL are discussed in an interdisciplinary context in many ﬁelds, such as language, science, mathematics, and technology. Methods such as robotic coding, programming, gamiﬁcation, and digital storytelling, especially suitable for DBL integrated into these areas, are essential in developing CT skills. These methods ensure that students build their learning processes by doing and experiencing. This part of the book will discuss the deﬁnition, scope, characteristics, related concepts, and dimensions of CT. Then, the deﬁnition, scope, characteristics, related concepts, and dimensions of DBL will be discussed. Finally, the effect of DBL environments on CT skills will be discussed with the support of the literature. Thus, it aims to reveal the advantages, limitations, difﬁculties, and connections between CT and DBL in education. This section will likely guide educators and those researching CT skills in DBL environments.},

	abstract = {Computational Thinking (CT) encompasses the cognitive processes utilized to articulate problems, allowing their resolution through computational steps and algorithms. Evolving into a centering skill applicable across diverse professional domains, CT extends beyond computer science, reaching learners in various disciplines. Its impact on education is evident as teachers integrate it from preschool to higher education levels. The role and signiﬁcance of CT in education can be outlined across four key dimensions, namely fostering problem-solving skills, preparing for the future workforce, fostering critical thinking skills, and exploring creativity. As the importance of CT continues to grow in the modern world, educators recognize the need to integrate CT into academic disciplines at all levels of education. However, the incorporation of CT into education presents both challenges and opportunities. One of the signiﬁcant challenges educators face is how to design and deliver CT learning activities that align with their teaching goals and objectives. Teachers must have the knowledge and skills to design and implement practical CT learning activities and assess students’ CT competencies. Addressing these challenges necessitates a robust foundation, where theoretical frameworks are crucial. Several theoretical frameworks have been proposed in the literature to address these challenges and guide educators in integrating CT into teaching. These frameworks offer guidelines and strategies for designing, delivering, and assessing CT learning activities. This chapter discusses three theoretical frameworks, namely problem-based instruction (PBI), Digital Storytelling (DST), and The CT Integration Elements. These frameworks were selected due to their alignment with the principles of design-based learning, which is the focus of this book. Each framework offers unique perspectives and approaches to integrating CT into teaching.},

	abstract = {Education systems intend to raise generations that produce digital solutions for our planet’s problems by providing students with computational thinking (CT) skills through programming activities. To realize this vision, children need to understand the needs and requirements of the beneﬁciaries in the digital products they will develop and produce solutions to these problems. Accordingly, design-based learning (DBL) can provide a framework for teachers who want to lead students in acquiring CT skills. Accordingly, this chapter suggests educational implications by focusing on integrating CT and DBL. The chapter begins with an overview of design thinking (DT) and deﬁnitions of DBL. Also, the chapter highlights the ﬁve key ideas found in DBL’s framework: (a) Authentic learning environment, (b) Learnercentered approach, (c) Inquiry and investigation, (d) Prototyping and iteration, (e) Fostering deep learning. Then, by touching on the disadvantages and advantages of DBL, the points that should be considered to expand its role in learning and teaching processes are emphasized. The chapter then summarizes the stages of design thinking (DT), providing an understanding of the methodological process that supports DBL. Following this introduction to DBL, examples of how it can help learners’ CT development are included. Thus, examples of how CT and DT can intersect are highlighted, and the potential beneﬁts of combining the two approaches are emphasized. In conclusion, this chapter highlights the transformative potential of combining DBL and CT in educational contexts.},

	abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) has received much attention in educational contexts in the recent years. One way to integrate Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is using design-based learning (DBL) that focuses on cyclical learning through designing, making, and reﬁning responses to complex issues. One of the widely practiced DBL activities is digital storytelling (DS) that refers to the production and dissemination of multimedia stories using digital tools. This book chapter introduces DS as a strategy for integrating ICT into the curriculum. The chapter also outlines how the DS project is initiated, with a selection of a problem or theme, followed by the creation of story, and the use of digital tools to produce the story in the format of multimedia. The chapter further discusses the ICT principles that are part of the activity, such as problem decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction and algorithm generation. In addition, it describes the beneﬁts of using ICT through DS including the improvement of students’ problem-solving skills, promotion of creativity and innovation among students and teamwork and communication. The chapter ends by highlighting the necessity of systematic and well-planned transition of ICT through DBL, and the considerable role of continuous teacher support and professional development for effective ICT integration. In a nutshell, this book chapter presents how DS facilitates the process of the integration of ICT into education curricula using DBL, outlining advantages and challenges of this approach for educators and students.},

We highlight in particular that although algorithmic approaches can support various stakeholders, such as parents, therapists, teachers, and the children themselves, they cannot and should not replace them. More generally, we will distinguish between different uses of algorithms, namely the description of observable data and the interpretation thereof. We also discuss some of the fundamental challenges, for example in assessing vaguely-deﬁned mental states.

The program’s primary goal is to empower academics to evaluate students’ practical skills through innovative technological strategies and tools. Developed within the collaborative framework of the D-Eva project, the programme underwent a participatory co-creation process involving academics, assessment experts, researchers, and digital content creators across four European countries. Its design draws from comprehensive research insights and considers crucial factors that foster academic and professional growth. Grounded in the belief that educators should actively shape their assessment methodologies, the programme positions them as reﬂective practitioners within a Professional Learning Community framework anchored in social constructivist principles. Moreover, the “D-Eva programme” adopts evidence-informed practices to facilitate teacher development in universities, accommodating diverse levels of digital literacy. It offers a range of resources, including a database housing various assessment activities, an online hub featuring examples of digital resources, and four self-paced micro-modules designed to support and enhance assessment practices.},

	abstract = {The landscape of assessment in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) higher education is undergoing a transformative shift as traditional pen-and-paper methods increasingly give way to digital tools. The present systematic literature review (SLR) delves into this dynamic domain, analyzing research published between 2019 and 2023 to map the current state of digital assessment adoption, its impact on student learning, and the persistent challenges that must be addressed. Drawing upon a curated selection of seven peer-reviewed articles guided by the PRISMA framework from databases like Web of Science (WoS), Scopus, and the Education Resources Information Center (ERIC), the study reveals a growing embrace of digital assessment tools like multiple data sets, ELARS, computer-mediated assessment, Vektor AR3-APP, and the OPERHOT platform. Innovations bring beneﬁts, such as enhanced student engagement, feedback mechanisms, and insights into learning processes. However, this digital transformation is not without its challenges. Concerns over limited faculty training, uneven technological access across institutions and student populations, and potential threats to academic integrity and data security demand immediate attention. Robust faculty development programs, equitable technology distribution initiatives, and the development of innovative security solutions are crucial for safeguarding the beneﬁts of digital assessment while mitigating its drawbacks. Moving beyond the current landscape, the review also explores the boundless potential of emerging technologies like AI-powered assessments and personalized learning analytics to revolutionize student learning and assessment practices in STEM disciplines. By shedding light on the current landscape, impact, and challenges, this SLR lays the groundwork for a future where digital assessment thrives in STEM higher education, empowering educators and unlocking students’ full potential. By proactively addressing the identiﬁed challenges and embracing the power of new technologies, this transformation can be nurtured, creating a vibrant and equitable learning environment for generations to come.},

	abstract = {Feedback, understood as an action, implies the process of making sense of information regarding the learning process and its use for self-improvement. In this sense, it is known that feedback could enhance self-regulation learning. Being a self-regulated learner entails skills that allow students to achieve their learning goals. There are different sources of feedback, but particularly with the incorporation of technologies that provide the possibilities to collect and analyse data from learning activities, learning analytics could be a source of feedback. However, it is fundamental to consider not only design factors and content but also the pedagogical background behind these tools. There are a signiﬁcant number of dashboards developed, but it has been found that they face difﬁculties in addressing the strengthening of self-regulation. As part of a research and innovation project analysis of the effects of feedback supported by digital monitoring technologies on generic competencies (e-FeedSkill), we developed a learner dashboard with the logs that we collected from a speciﬁc didactical sequence settled in Moodle aimed at promoting self-regulation in higher education. In this paper, we present a case study describing and critically analysing the decisions made during the iterative process of designing and developing a learning analytics dashboard for higher education students.},

The expansion of Internet networks has made it possible to connect easily from a wide variety of locations, both in training establishments and at home. These tools ﬁrst appeared in the form of MOOCs, then in the form of interactive videos included in smart education. Their development is associated with the rise of connected objects, and thus of the digital world, which is expanding exponentially. Microelectronics is at the heart of the digital world, the hard-ware part of the sector, and plays a major societal role. Indeed, this ﬁeld is responsible for the consumption of electrical energy and the depletion of many of the planet’s resources. The exponential growth in usage is leading to an energy dead-end, which is also limiting smart-education. To master these phenomena, we need to develop microelectronics training in specialties capable of seriously reducing energy consumption, and thus provide the associated skills, knowledge and know-how. It is with these objectives in mind that the strengths and weaknesses are highlighted in this document. Particular attention is paid to microelectronics engineering and the solutions proposed by the French national microelectronics training network to meet future challenges.},

With the growing incorporation of multimedia and interactive elements in educational materials, understanding how students engage with these features, especially tests, is crucial for both improving learning experiences and providing educators with insights into the learning process. Through sequence analysis of log data from an Estonian E-Book Opiq, the research identiﬁes distinct patterns in how students with varying levels of procedural mathematical competence approach tests in E-Books. The analysis focuses on students’ interactions with tests, categorizing them based on their procedural math competence and examining the types of tests (multiple choice or open response questions) they took. The ﬁndings reveal differences in test-taking strategies and outcomes between students of high and low procedural math competence, highlighting the potential of sequence analysis not only as a research tool but also as a means for educators to gain a deeper understanding of student engagement and learning processes. By integrating sequence analysis into digital learning environments, educators could access valuable insights to tailor and enhance the educational experience.},

The sample group consisted of 303 individuals from primary education schools in the northeastern region, including 192 teachers and 111 school administrators, selected through simple random sampling. The research methodology employed was survey research, which gathered both quantitative and qualitative data. The ﬁndings revealed that: For teachers (N = 192), the current assessment of their own development in ICT competency and digital literacy skills indicated signiﬁcant issues (x = 3.84, SD = 0.77) and high essential needs (x = 3.96, SD = 0.72). Their self-assessment for professional competence enhancement also showed substantial issues (x = 3.88, SD = 0.74) and very high needs (x = 4.08, SD = 0.67). For school administrators (N = 111), the self-assessment regarding their development in ICT competency and digital literacy skills highlighted major issues (x = 4.02, SD = 0.81) and the highest level of essential needs (x = 4.27, SD = 0.68). Their self-assessment for professional competence enhancement also indicated signiﬁcant issues (x = 4.04, SD = 0.82) and the highest needs (x = 4.27, SD = 0.63).},

	abstract = {The study explores the impact of prior knowledge on the motivation and effectiveness of using the English Sentence Rearrangement Practice System. Through an empirical investigation involving 87 ﬁrst-year students from a nursing department in northern Taiwan, the research investigates the relationship between prior knowledge, learning motivation, and learning effectiveness. The study consisted of an 8-week experimental teaching program, with 100 min of instruction each week. In the ﬁrst week, participants received an introduction to the system and completed a pre-test. Through the second to the seventh weeks, learners engaged in individual practice using the system either during or after class. In the eighth week, participants underwent a post-test examination and completed the ARCS (Attention, Relevance, Conﬁdence, and Satisfaction) learning motivation questionnaire. Findings suggest that while there is no signiﬁcant difference in learning motivation between learners with high and low prior knowledge levels, the use of the English Sentence Rearrangement Practice System effectively sustains learners’ motivation levels, as evidenced by consistently high average values of the ARCS. Moreover, the system signiﬁcantly enhances learning effectiveness, particularly for learners with low prior knowledge, indicating its potential to bridge performance gaps. These results underscore the importance of instructional approaches and the integration of digital technologies in language learning contexts. The study contributes certain observations into enhancing language teaching strategies to support learners in their language acquisition journey.},

(GIO)” presents the results of a study examining one underlying mechanism of successful digital cooperation among students in higher education from a student perspective. We investigated whether and how students’ cooperative mindset and the climate in their university courses correlate with how they perceive the impact of digital cooperation on their learning outcomes. Data were collected using a questionnaire in different university courses at three universities, involving students from different study programmes and semesters. We conducted a mediation analysis that included students’ cooperative mindsets, the perception of the course climate, and the perception of the impact of digital cooperation on students’ learning outcomes. We found that students’ cooperative mindsets predicted their perception of the impact of digital cooperation on their learning. The cooperative mindset of students also predicted their perception of the course climate, which, in turn, predicted their perception of the impact of digital cooperation on their learning. Moreover, we found that the effect of students’ cooperative mindset on the perceived impact of digital cooperation on learning was mediated by the perception of the course climate. These ﬁndings suggest that highlighting the relevance of digital cooperation for learning outcomes can initiate a positive dynamic shaping students’ perceptions of their course climate and beneﬁts of digital cooperation. Understanding these dynamics is crucial because cooperative group work in digital environments has become an integral part of teaching in higher education.},

Students must be empowered to deal with such uncertainty to support developing a sense of critical consciousness and agency. Drawing on the discourse of uncertainty in educational science, this qualitative secondary analysis (QSA) refers to two studies that focused on instructional ‘uncertainty-friendly’ settings in four different school subjects (biology, drama and physical education in one study and English as a foreign language in the other) to address the research question: What are students’ responses to didactically staged confrontations with disciplinary uncertainty in different subjects? In the analysed studies, the researchers established uncertainty-friendly settings as an instructional tool to foster deep learning and cognitive ﬂexibility in K–12 students. This QSA compares students’ reactions to these settings. The ﬁndings suggest a cross-curricular pattern of student responses: In all subjects, students initially showed unspeciﬁc responses, all of which acknowledged uncertainty. In addition, students showed speciﬁc responses (i.e. the modes of juxtaposition, exploration and rejection) as active interactions with the uncertainty of the settings. The results can further the development of uncertainty-friendly classrooms and reﬂection on their limitations.},

A total of 91 university students were randomly assigned to either use ChatGPT3.5 or Google to research the socio-scientific issue of nanoparticles in sunscreen to derive valid recommendations and justifications. The study aimed to investigate potential differences in cognitive load, as well as the quality and homogeneity of the students’ recommendations and justifications. Results indicated that students using LLMs experienced significantly lower cognitive load. However, despite this reduction, these students demonstrated lower-quality reasoning and argumentation in their final recommendations compared to those who used traditional search engines. Further, the homogeneity of the recommendations and justifications did not differ significantly between the two groups, suggesting that LLMs did not restrict the diversity of students’ perspectives. These findings highlight the nuanced implications of digital tools on learning, suggesting that while LLMs can decrease the cognitive burden associated with information gathering during a learning task, they may not promote deeper engagement with content necessary for high-quality learning per se.},

Furthermore, it is time to explore the interplay between these two spaces. Therefore, we proposed employing a holistic approach to develop a new conceptual model for Designing Teaching and Learning Environments (DTALE). To do this, the paper presents first a critical review of the research literature underpinning learning environments, with a particular interest in the integration of the physical and digital spaces, to develop the DTALE model. In the second step, the DTALE model has been developed and validated by applying the model to existing cases from different contexts. Based on the study’s findings, we outline the implications for theory and practice. Limitations and suggestions for future research are also included.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            With progressive digitalization of healthcare systems worldwide, large-scale collection of electronic health records (EHRs) has become commonplace. However, an extensible framework for comprehensive exploratory analysis that accounts for data heterogeneity is missing. Here we introduce ehrapy, a modular open-source Python framework designed for exploratory analysis of heterogeneous epidemiology and EHR data. ehrapy incorporates a series of analytical steps, from data extraction and quality control to the generation of low-dimensional representations. Complemented by rich statistical modules, ehrapy facilitates associating patients with disease states, differential comparison between patient clusters, survival analysis, trajectory inference, causal inference and more. Leveraging ontologies, ehrapy further enables data sharing and training EHR deep learning models, paving the way for foundational models in biomedical research. We demonstrate ehrapy’s features in six distinct examples. We applied ehrapy to stratify patients affected by unspecified pneumonia into finer-grained phenotypes. Furthermore, we reveal biomarkers for significant differences in survival among these groups. Additionally, we quantify medication-class effects of pneumonia medications on length of stay. We further leveraged ehrapy to analyze cardiovascular risks across different data modalities. We reconstructed disease state trajectories in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) based on imaging data. Finally, we conducted a case study to demonstrate how ehrapy can detect and mitigate biases in EHR data. ehrapy, thus, provides a framework that we envision will standardize analysis pipelines on EHR data and serve as a cornerstone for the community.},

Based on the Job Demands-Resources Model (Demerouti et al. 2001) and Rudow’s (1994) framework model of teacher stress and strain, data from the ICILS 2018 was used to analyze various work tasks and conditions that place positive or negative strains on teachers working with ICT and can therefore promote or impair health and job performance in the long term. It was found that the majority of the n = 2251 teachers surveyed perceive a neutral level of strain for most of the characteristics recorded. Around half of the teachers feel burdened by the quality of the technical equipment and the internet at the school. In other areas, e.g., lesson preparation and post-processing, the use of ICT is perceived as a positive strain. The teachers were divided into four groups with similar response patterns using latent proﬁle analyses. The proﬁles with the strongest negative and positive strains are low (6\% and 10\% of the sample). There are differences between the proﬁles in terms of the age and gender of the teachers and their attitudes towards digital media in the classroom. On the other hand, there are no differences concerning teachers’ digitalization-related skills between the four proﬁles.},

	abstract = {Primary school teachers face a great degree of heterogeneity in their daily teaching. Identifying the individual learning needs of their pupils and ﬁnding suitable solutions can be challenging for them. Digital learning platforms can offer support here: If digital learning platforms are used for practicing in class, teachers have a wide range of data about their students’ learning process at their disposal. With the information that teachers gain from the data, they can derive individualization and differentiation measures. Research on data-based decision making shows that data can be used for decisions in the school and teaching context. There are already approaches for modeling the use of data for decision-making in a circular and process-based manner. For the German-speaking context, however, the processbased use of digital data for instructional design is still widely unexplored. This paper introduces an exploratory study that contributes insights into how teachers use data from digital learning platforms to inform their teaching and how this use can be described along the circle of data-based decision making. To answer the research question, a qualitative research design with a method triangulation of interviews, thinking aloud and observations was used. The results show that the use of data from digital learning platforms by primary school teachers can be described along the ﬁve steps of data-based decision-making, but that there are inter-individual differences between the teachers. For example, some teachers only take a look at the data provided by the learning platform in a dashboard without using it further. Other teachers also interpret the data and derive implications for their further lesson planning. The ﬁndings from the interviews, the thinking aloud method and the lesson observations are combined, discussed and implications for educational practice and research are derived.},

It begins by introducing the didactic triangle model to analyze traditional teacher-student-content interactions and how this model is extended to a tetrahedron model including digital technologies. The text then reviews existing literature on the role of AI in education, exploring the performance, roles, and capabilities of AI text generators in educational contexts. These studies highlight the transformative potential of AI technologies in reshaping the role of teachers, who are seen as mediators and collaborators rather than mere information providers. The paper concludes that while AI text generators offer promising avenues for personalized and efficient learning, they also raise ethical and practical concerns that need to be addressed, like data privacy, the risk of misinformation, and the need for teachers to acquire new skills to effectively integrate AI into their teaching practices. The paper suggests that traditional didactic models may need to be revised to account for the complexities introduced by AI technologies, including their autonomous and adaptive nature. The paper calls for a multi-dimensional approach that considers pedagogical, ethical, and organizational aspects of education in the age of AI.},

Complex process-oriented teaching-learning methods, such as inverted classrooms, portfolios or blog writing, help students to actively engage with academic content.

A major challenge to the successful implementation of such settings is the lack of time resources for teachers to provide such feedback to a larger group of students.

In digital learning, these aspects manifest within dyads, groups, communities, and networks, and are therefore included in theoretical accounts of learning. Independently, social network research that focuses on understanding social groups and networks also offers elaborate theoretical views on social relations. The analysis of digital learning requires the integration of views from both domains. This chapter focuses on how to connect social network analysis with digital learning theories. We argue that inferring social networks from digital trace data requires careful conceptualization of social networks within digital learning theories. We review three approaches to learning, namely, knowledge building, networked learning, and connectivism, and highlight how these lenses implicate different views of social processes and therefore distinct ways social networks can be constructed from learning data. In doing so, we illuminate conceptual distinctions undergirding seemingly identical data sources and illustrate how they can be used to model digital learning processes under close guidance of digital learning theories.},

Guided by Winne and Hadwin’s COPES model (1998), SRL was operationalized at a coarse level with students’ online log data and course assessment scores representing their SRL operations and products of SRL in the course, respec­ tively. Results of mixed ANOVAs and chi-square tests of independence showed that the LA-based feedback enhanced students’ completion rate of online learning activities and their study regu­ larity. The treatment group exhibited superior performance in the final examination compared to the comparison group, providing evidence of the positive impact of LA-based feedback on stu­ dents’ course performance.

The advent of digital technology has made it possible to design interactive digital stories and use them as a mean to deliver the educational content in an engaging and memorable manner. These allow the learners to control the outcome of the story based on their interactions. As a result, the learner receives a personalized experience, and it increases the user’s sense of autonomy. Although the role of storytelling in education has been extensively studied, not so much research has been dedicated to how learning analytics can be used in personalising student experience and facilitating assessment. In this chapter, through a pilot study, we explore whether assessing and providing student feedback about their learning through the story results in improved learning. We have performed an experimental-control study to check whether the changes lead to improved learning outcomes. Control group participants were given interactive digital storytelling as initially designed while the experimental group was exposed to the version with the assessment and feedback embedded. This version uses learning analytics to provide feedback on the understanding of the educational material. All the participants’ knowledge of the learning objectives covered in the storytelling was assessed before and after being exposed to it. The results showed that there was no statistically significant improvement in participants’ knowledge as a result of feedback. Although knowledge improvement has not been statistically significant, participants had an improved experience on the version with feedback integrated.},

	abstract = {In this article, we offer theory-grounded narratives of a 4-year participatory design process of a Learning Analytics tool with K-12 educators. We describe how we design-in-partnership by leveraging educators' routines, values and cultural representations into the designs of digital dashboards. We make our long-term reasoning visible by reflecting upon how design decisions were made, discussing key tensions and analysing to what extent the developed tools were taken up in practice. Through thick design narratives, we reflect upon how cultural forms—recognizable cultural constructs that might cue and facilitate specific activities—were identified among educators and informed the design of a dashboard. We then examined the extent to which the designed tool supported coaches and teachers to engage in Generative Uncertainty, an interpretive stance in which educators manifest productive inquiries towards data. Our analysis highlights that attuning to cultural forms is a valuable first step but not enough towards designing LA tools for systems in ways that fit institutionalized practices, challenge instrumental uses and spur productive inquiry. We conclude by offering two key criteria for making culturally-grounded design decisions in the context of long-term partnerships. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Participatory design can invite stakeholders to directly inform the creation of LA artefacts that fit their needs, context and cultural markers. What this paper adds Cultural forms can be identified and leveraged in the design of LA tools. HCLA scholars ought to design for systems—the complex body of organizational routines, cultural practices and interactions among multiple stakeholders—and not just for users. Implications for practice and/or policy Leveraging cultural forms in LA needs to be accompanied by a critical view of which practices, behaviours, values and structures are suggested by such forms. Designing features that are easy to use, are associated with concrete tasks, and fit into existing cultural practices are three criteria for embedding cultural forms into LA design.},

	abstract = {Even highly motivated undergraduates drift off their STEM career pathways. In large introductory STEM classes, instructors struggle to identify and support these students. To address these issues, we developed co-redesign methods in partnership with disciplinary experts to create high-structure STEM courses that better support students and produce informative digital event data. To those data, we applied theory- and context-relevant labels to reflect active and self-regulated learning processes involving LMS-hosted course materials, formative assessments, and help-seeking tools. We illustrate the predictive benefits of this process across two cycles of model creation and reapplication. In cycle 1, we used theory-relevant features from 3 weeks of data to inform a prediction model that accurately identified struggling students and sustained its accuracy when reapplied in future semesters. In cycle 2, we refit a model with temporally contextualized features that achieved superior accuracy using data from just two class meetings. This modelling approach can produce durable learning analytics solutions that afford scaled and sustained prediction and intervention opportunities that involve explainable artificial intelligence products. Those same products that inform prediction can also guide intervention approaches and inform future instructional design and delivery.Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Learning analytics includes an evolving collection of methods for tracing and understanding student learning through their engagements with learning technologies. Prediction models based on demographic data can perpetuate systemic biases. Prediction models based on behavioural event data can produce accurate predictions of academic success, and validation efforts can enrich those data to reflect students' self-regulated learning processes within learning tasks. What this paper adds Learning analytics can be successfully applied to predict performance in an authentic postsecondary STEM context, and the use of context and theory as guides for feature engineering can ensure sustained predictive accuracy upon reapplication. The consistent types of learning resources and cyclical nature of their provisioning from lesson to lesson are hallmarks of high-structure active learning designs that are known to benefit learners. These designs also provide opportunities for observing and modelling contextually grounded, theory-aligned and temporally positioned learning events that informed prediction models that accurately classified students upon initial and later reapplications in subsequent semesters. Co-design relationships where researchers and instructors work together toward pedagogical implementation and course instrumentation are essential to developing unique insights for feature engineering and producing explainable artificial intelligence approaches to predictive modelling. Implications for practice and/or policy High-structure course designs can scaffold student engagement with course materials to make learning more effective and products of feature engineering more explainable. Learning analytics initiatives can avoid perpetuation of systemic biases when methods prioritize theory-informed behavioural data that reflect learning processes, sensitivity to instructional context and development of explainable predictors of success rather than relying on students' demographic characteristics as predictors. Prioritizing behaviours as predictors improves explainability in ways that can inform the redesign of courses and design of learning supports, which further informs the refinement of learning theories and their applications.},

	abstract = {This article maps considerations of inclusiveness and support for students with disabilities by reviewing articles within the field of learning analytics. The study involved a PRISMA-informed systematic review of two popular digital libraries, namely Clarivate’s Web of Science, and Elsevier’s Scopus for peer-reviewed journal articles and conference proceedings. A final corpus of 26 articles was analysed. Findings show that although the field of learning analytics emerged in 2011, none of the studies identified here covered topics of inclusiveness in education before the year of 2016. Screening also shows that learning analytics provides great potential to promote inclusiveness in terms of reducing discrimination, increasing retention among disadvantaged students, and validating particular learning designs for marginalised groups. Gaps in this potential are also identified. The article aims to provide valuable insight into what is known about learning analytics and inclusiveness and contribute knowledge to this particular nascent area for researchers and institutional stakeholders.},

	abstract = {This research studies the motivational factors used in educational video games through the lens of 6 C’s learning motivation model with text mining of the players’ reviews and comments. This research seeks to offer insight for game producers and educational institutions to investigate the effectiveness of these motivators for increasing player motivations and thus improving the quality of learning. Sentiment analysis and LDA topic modeling were used to analyze reviews of five selected video games on the Steam platform. The 6 C’s Learning Motivation Model guided text mining to analyze the motivational factors used in the games and how they contribute to user learning. The effectiveness of these motivational factors was discussed in conjunction with categorized text mining. Results show that the major motivation factors of educational games are ‘construction meaning’, ‘challenge’, and ‘control’ in the 6 C’s learning motivation model. Among them, users focus on whether the game’s content meets their interests and the construction of the educational meaning of the game. The advantage of control, a high degree of motivational factor in video games, may turn out to be a factor that leads to user churning when the game is not interesting or attractive enough. Previous educational game research seldom involved a large sample size for generalizable findings. In addition, this research extends the application of the 6 C’s learning motivation model to the digital educational gaming arena, providing a novel player-centric perspective. Based on the results, we provide recommendations and design considerations for educational game developers to enhance players’ experience and motivations.},

Die Ko-Labs nehmen den doppelten Praxisbezug der beruflichen Bildung durch Praxisakteure aus der Wirtschaft und verschiedene Expert*innen der Lehrkräftebildung auf (vgl. Dilger et al. 2022; Albrecht et al. 2022). Gemeint sind Betriebspartner*innen, Vertreter*innen der Fachdidaktiken und Spezialist*innen für gesellschaftsrelevante Querschnittsthemen (Inklusion und Sprachbildung, Digitalisierung, Nachhaltigkeit sowie Diagnostik). In diesem Sinne wird die Kompetenzentwicklung sowohl durch den Einbezug außeruniversitärer Praxisakteure als auch durch die Integration gesellschaftsrelevanter Querschnittsthemen gefördert. Dabei sollen die Studierenden u.a. lernen, die Arbeits- und Lebenswelt in den Lernaufgaben abzubilden, indem sie dazu angehalten werden, berufsspezifische und gesellschaftsrelevante Thematiken in die Lernaufgaben authentisch zu integrieren. Um Letzteres zu gewährleisten sind von Expert*innen der jeweiligen Querschnittsthemen Lehrformate vorbereitet worden, welche pandemiebedingt im digitalen Raum stattfanden. In einer ersten Reaktion auf die neuen Rahmenbedingungen wurden die für eine analoge Hochschulpraxis ausgearbeiteten Seminare nahezu spiegelbildlich in den digitalen Lernraum überführt, d.h. Seminarablauf und -struktur blieben weitgehend erhalten ohne dabei die erweiterten Potentiale digitaler Möglichkeiten zu berücksichtigen. Dieser im Angesicht des damaligen "Lockdowns" geplante Ansatz wurde im Laufe der Kooperationslabore u. a. mittels leitfadengestützter Studierendeninterviews überprüft und weiterentwickelt, um eine hochwertige und gute Lehrpraxis zu etablieren. In Anbetracht der Rückkehr zu analogen Präsenzveranstaltungen und manch positiver Erfahrungen mit der digitalen Lehre während mehrerer digitaler Durchläufe der Ko-Labs stellen sich verschiedene Fragen, die in diesem Beitrag aufgegriffen werden: Welche Elemente der digitalen Lehre sind erhaltenswert? Wie können die positiven Aspekte der digitalen Lehre in analoge Formate überführt und nutzbar gemacht werden? Unter Zuhilfenahme der in der Bildungsstrategie der Kultusministerkonferenz (KMK 2016 u. 2021) dargestellten Prinzipien und Ideale für eine Bildung in der digitalen Welt und den Ergebnissen der Studierendeninterviews wird sowohl die Überarbeitung der Umsetzung ins digitale Lehrformat beschrieben als auch reflektiert, was im analogen bzw. hybriden Lernraum erhalten bleiben sollte.

	abstract = {With English education using big data and learning analytics represents a transformative approach to enhancing language learning outcomes and pedagogical practices. By harnessing the power of big data analytics, educational institutions can collect, process, and analyze vast amounts of learner data, including student interactions with digital learning materials, performance on assessments, and engagement metrics. Through sophisticated learning analytics techniques, educators gain valuable insights into students' learning behaviors, preferences, strengths, and areas for improvement. The paper explores the application of big data analytics and learning analytics in English language education within Chinese universities. Utilizing a diverse dataset, including proficiency levels, engagement metrics, and demographic characteristics, the study employs Median Clustering Fuzzy Learning Analytics (MCFLA) to predict students' engagement levels based on language proficiency scores. Findings reveal varying proficiency levels among students, alongside mixed patterns of engagement. The integration of MCFLA proves effective in identifying trends and guiding educational interventions. Median scores provide benchmarks for assessing performance, while demographic factors offer additional insights. Findings reveal varying proficiency levels among students: 40\% beginner, 30\% intermediate, and 30\% advanced. Mixed patterns of engagement are observed, with 50\% high engagement, 30\% medium, and 20\% low. Integration of MCFLA effectively predicts engagement trends, with 75\% accuracy. Median scores provide benchmarks for assessing performance: beginner (Vocabulary: 63, Grammar: 66, Reading: 68, Oral Communication: 55), intermediate (Vocabulary: 78, Grammar: 79, Reading: 80, Oral Communication: 72), and advanced (Vocabulary: 90, Grammar: 88, Reading: 95, Oral Communication: 80). Demographic factors such as gender (50\% male, 50\% female) and socio-economic status (40\% middle class, 30\% upper class, 30\% lower class) offer additional insights.},

	abstract = {Blended learning (BL) combines traditional classroom activities with online learning resources, enabling students to obtain higher academic performance through well-defined interactive learning strategies. However, lacking the capacity to selfregulate their learning, many students might fail to comprehensively study the learning materials after face-to-face learning. In this study, a learning analytics dashboard (LAD)-based self-regulated learning (SRL) approach is proposed to enhance the students’ practices of SRL in an e-book-based BL environment. The proposed approach aims to support students to precisely reflect on their face-to-face e-book reading activities, effectively review the e-book learning materials after the face-to-face learning sessions, and, finally, set new goals for their next face-to-face learning session by using a LAD. To evaluate the effects of the proposed approach, a quasi-experimental design was deployed in a university-level course that adopted a BL model. The experimental group learned through the proposed approach using an e-book and the LAD, whereas the control group learned using the conventional BL approach using only the e-book. The results of the one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and Mann–Whitney U test demonstrate a statistically significant difference (p-value less than 0.01) between both groups in terms of students’ learning outcomes, awareness of SRL, self-efficacy (SE), and e-book reading engagements. This provides educators with evidence of the effectiveness of an explicit SRL approach in BL, which not only improves student learning outcomes from the given course and awareness of self-regulation and SE but also increases course engagement compared to students who learn with conventional BL approaches.},

Using this data format creates the foundation for combining video interactions with other logs for more in-depth analyses. The analyses are conducted periodically, every 24 h. Advantages and challenges resulting from this approach are presented. It is described how the dashboard, visualizing the analysis results, was designed and how the analysis results are stored such that they can be retrieved as fast as possible. Overall, the setup of the video analytics system is quite extensive, as two Moodle plugins and Excalibur LA need to be set up. The advantages however, especially in the long term, including analyzing video interactions with other logs or easy extensibility with new analyses, outweigh the initial effort. The system was pilot tested in a blended learning course where videos were an addition to the lectures. The analysis results show little consumption of the videos, which limits the insights into the video usage. Still, the dashboard’s usability was rated good and the reports were considered promising in terms of providing more insights when more data is given. To further evaluate this potential, the system was integrated in a flipped classroom and a self-learning course where video usage was more central than within the pilot test course.},

	abstract = {Education system nowadays has moved forward in digitalization. The evolution of the education system brings learning institutions that offer online knowledge delivery as an alternative also in addition to giving more flexibility to learners gaining knowledge. This will benefit learners as they can set up their own environment when attending a class. However, the online environment means that learners and teachers are not interacting directly anymore. This led to low engagement between learner and teacher. Engagements between learner and teacher or the course itself are important as engagement will increase learner motivation in attending a class or completing a course. Gamification can be implemented to increase student engagement in online learning. To understand how far gamification contributes to increasing learner engagement and how it affects learner performance, this research is conducted. First, this research will study the engagement of learner in different parameters. The study mainly focuses on the trend of engagement on the respective parameter. For instance, the trend of learners engaging in the course by sharing their opinion in the comment section and how much did the learner spend their time on the course. The findings were used to identify the type of gamification that engage student more towards the course. The study about the enrolments trends was also done for this research.},

Despite the increasing number of empirical studies in the field, there has been no systematic investigation of what games, or their elements, have been applied in the writing classroom. The aim of this study was to summarize the empirical evidence on using game-related approaches, including game-based learning and gamification, to teach writing. Twenty-two studies were analyzed, revealing the following findings: (1) various types of games were used for writing instruction, including digital educational games, non-digital educational games, and digital non-educational games; (2) digital educational games were the most common game type reported in the literature, and such games were used to create authentic and interactive learning environments, provide writing practice opportunities, and evaluate students’ writing skills; (3) various game elements, such as points, leaderboards, storylines, and role-playing, were incorporated to develop gamified activities; and (4) students participated in such gamified activities in online and hybrid modes. Taken as a whole, the findings show how games and their elements are used for teaching and learning writing. Suggestions and implications are provided for practitioners and researchers in the field.},

	abstract = {In recent times, technology has played a significant role in education, with artificial intelligence (AI), one of these technological tools, becoming an emerging topic in education. It has been of great concern to professionals and researchers in the fields of science and education. The growing and/or increasing power of this app in society and in the education sector, especially as it affects the teaching profession, or teachers, to be specific, is of great worry and/or a profound risk. Education has been the basis for all progressive nations, and teachers have also been the main part of this progress, as they remain at the helm of major instructional decisions and the management of any of these innovative ideas to improve the teaching-learning process. With advances in technology and constant technological innovations, teachers are constantly refusing to adopt or integrate any of these innovative technologies or ideas in the education system. Artificial intelligence has become one of these innovative ideas, and is currently an emerging topic in the education system in recent years, threatening the foundations of teachers or educators in recent times. This paper focused on the argument that teaching machines will or will not replace human teachers in the classroom. Therefore, the researchers hope to find out from the existing literature if artificial intelligence could, in reality, replace the job of teachers in the classroom or act as an enhancer for teachers in the entire education sector. The paper further discussed the merits of AI in the modern classroom. The need for IT literacy among teachers and students alike in contemporary education structures was also discussed. The paper finally looked into the teachers’ challenges against successful implementation of artificial intelligence teaching machines in the education process and made recommendations and suggestions for sequential improvements.},

	abstract = {Gamification is the use of game elements in a non-game context to encourage desired behaviours. It has been identified as a promising strategy for improving user motivation on e-learning platforms. Since previous literature reviews and meta-analyses only considered gamification and learning efforts without focusing directly on the gamification elements and their impact, a research gap was identified. Based on the studies analysed, the most commonly used gamification elements in the literature were identified and examined to determine whether there are any significant results in terms of motivational changes. Three areas of research questions were formulated for this meta-analysis: Which gamification elements should be used to increase learning motivation in asynchronous e-learning? Which success factors should be considered to increase the motivation of the learners when using gamification elements? Is there a specific selection of gamification elements that significantly increase motivation in asynchronous e-learning? The literature search process followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) methodology. Afterward, the studies were examined to determine their relevance based on defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The next step was title and abstract screening, followed by a full-text screening. A complementary search of the included literature was then conducted using snowballing techniques. Finally, the most relevant literature was reviewed using quality assessment criteria. Our analysis concluded that the most promising gamification elements are badges, leaderboards, level up systems and progress bars. The combination of elements increases users’ motivation significantly, especially the combination of badges with leaderboards or level up systems. These insights can contribute to the design of e-learning platforms and online courses.},

	abstract = {Currently, primary and secondary school education quality is a major source of concern for educators. A significant number of factors, such as the development of scientific and technological progress, technological innovations, and digitalization, affect the quality of education. In recent years, teachers have come to believe that the textbook they choose has a big influence on their students’ academic performance. To determine the difficulties of selecting e-learning materials for primary school students, a quasi-experimental study was conducted. The challenge of choosing instructional materials was examined using the example of a teacher’s selection of a mathematics textbook. The purpose of the study was to determine the extent to which the teacher’s selection of an e-textbook for mathematics instruction affected the performance of fourth-grade students. The two selected test groups of the same size (140 students) included students from an elementary city school in Russia. The participants were nine years old on average. Participants in the second experimental group performed better on the final test (74.71) than those in the first (65.9), per ANCOVA analysis. There was a significant difference between the two groups’ test results (F = 10.84, p {\textless} 0.05). The findings demonstrated that primary school students’ performance levels can be significantly impacted by the choice of electronic textbooks to teach them. Additionally, the study indicated useful criteria for the selection of high-quality e-textbooks by teachers. These criteria allow educators to make a choice that may significantly influence the educational process. The findings of this study demonstrate that using e-textbook approval guidelines based on theoretically sound quality indicators can help prevent the use of subpar textbooks in classrooms and raise the standard of textbooks in general. The educational opportunities offered by primary school textbooks may also have an impact on students’ performances in higher grades.},

              Hintergrund
              Die deutsche universitäre HNO-Heilkunde hat Bedarf an digitalen Lehrinhalten. Fallbasiertes E‑Learning stellt eine digitale Lehrmethodik dar. Die Datenlage zur studentischen Nutzung von fallbasiertem E‑Learning in der Hochschullehre der HNO-Heilkunde ist limitiert.
            
            
              Fragestellung
              Ziel dieser Arbeit war es festzustellen, in welchem Umfang freiwilliges fallbasiertes E‑Learning von Studierenden der HNO-Heilkunde genutzt wird und welchen Einfluss die Qualität des E‑Learnings auf die Motivation zur E‑Learning-Nutzung und auf das Interesse für die HNO-Heilkunde hat.
            
            
              Material und Methoden
              Es wurden 15 freiwillige E‑Learning-Fälle erstellt, welche auf den Inhalten der HNO-Vorlesung im Wintersemester 2022/2023 basierten. Im Anschluss erfolgte eine deskriptive Auswertung der Nutzungsstatistiken der Fälle von 157 Studierenden. Ebenso wurde eine Evaluation der Qualität des E‑Learnings sowie der Motivation zur Durchführung und des Interesses für die HNO-Heilkunde mittels eines freiwilligen Fragebogens durchgeführt.
            
            
              Ergebnisse
              Freiwilliges fallbasiertes E‑Learning wurde von 66 \% der Studierenden in unterschiedlichem Ausmaß genutzt. Die Qualität des E‑Learnings korrelierte signifikant mit der Motivation zur Durchführung und dem Interesse für die HNO-Heilkunde.
            
            
              Schlussfolgerung
              Lehrinhalte der HNO-Heilkunde lassen sich suffizient in fallbasiertes E‑Learning implementieren und zeichnen sich durch eine zufriedenstellende studentische Akzeptanz aus.

            Abstract
            
              Background
              German university otorhinolaryngology has a need for digital teaching content. Case-based e‑learning represents a digital teaching methodology. The data on student use of case-based e‑learning in university teaching of ENT medicine are limited.
            
            
              Objective
              The aim of this work was to determine the extent to which voluntary case-based e‑learning is used by otolaryngology students and what influence the quality of the e‑learning has on motivation to use e‑learning and on the interest in otolaryngology.
            
            
              Materials and methods
              Fifteen voluntary e‑learning cases were created based on the content of the ENT lecture in the winter semester 2022/2023. Subsequently, a descriptive evaluation of the usage statistics of the cases of 157 students was conducted. Likewise, an evaluation of the quality of the e‑learning as well as the motivation to complete it and the interest in otorhinolaryngology was carried out using a voluntary questionnaire.
            
            
              Results
              Voluntary case-based e‑learning was used to varying degrees by 66\% of the students. The quality of e‑learning correlated significantly with the motivation and the interest in otolaryngology.
            
            
              Conclusion
              The teaching content of otorhinolaryngology can be implemented sufficiently in case-based e‑learning and is characterized by satisfactory student acceptance. Integration should be accomplished in a high-quality manner to increase motivation and interest in otorhinolaryngology.},

	abstract = {This study considered how digital collaboration can improve English majors' Reading Comprehension (RC) and Vocabulary Learning (VL). It employed tests and semi-structured interviews to investigate whether differences exist between Collaborative Digital Learning (CDL) and Individual Digital Learning (IDL) regarding participants’ reading comprehension and vocabulary learning and to explore EFL learners’ perceptions of CDL. Sixty EFL majors enrolled in two sections of the same course- RC and VL- were randomly assigned to a treatment group and a control group. Both groups were pre-tested before performing the assigned digital activities through the learning management platform and Quizlet website. At the end of the course, both groups were post-tested. The treatment group was only individually interviewed about CDL's impact and perceptions. The results revealed that CDL had improved students' RC and VL. The treatment group outperformed the control group in the post-test scores in the test dimensions, RC and VL, and in the overall scores of the test. The analyses, including paired-sample t-tests, independent-sample t-tests, Cohen'd statistics, and qualitative content analysis, indicated more significant benefits of CDL over IDL in improving RC and VL.

	abstract = {Introduction  In response to the COVID-19 crisis, this study aimed to introduce a new virtual teaching model for anatomy education that combines Peer-Assisted Learning (PAL) and flipped classrooms, aligning with constructivist principles.
Method  The Flipped Peer Assisted (FPA) method was implemented in a virtual neuroanatomy course for second-year medical students at Birjand University of Medical Sciences via a descriptive study. The method involved small groups of PAL, with peer learning serving as educational assistants and the teacher acting as a facilitator. Educational content was uploaded to the university’s learning management system (LMS). The opinion of medical students regarding the teaching method were evaluated using a 15-item questionnaire on a five-point Likert scale.
Results  A total of 210 students participated in the instruction using the FPA method. The analysis of students’ scores revealed an average score of 26.75 ± 3.67 on the 30-point test. According to student feedback, this teaching method effectively motivated students to study, enhanced teamwork and communication skills, transformed their perspective on the anatomy course, provided opportunities for formative assessment and feedback, and demonstrated the teacher’s dedication to education.
Conclusion  The FPA model demonstrates its effectiveness in transforming traditional classroom teaching and fostering teaching and learning in virtual environments, particularly during pandemics like COVID-19. This model holds promise for enhancing anatomy education in challenging circumstances.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The present study investigated the efficacy of the didactic approaches of video modeling (VM, best-practice examples), video reflection (VR, problem-based approach), and the combination of both (VMR) in fostering medical communication competence in a video-based digital learning environment.
METHODS: N = 126 third-year medical students who participated in the pre-post study were assigned to either the intervention groups (VM, VR, and VMR) or the wait-list control group. The efficacy of the three approaches was assessed by means of a situational judgment test (SJT) of medical communication competence. To investigate the differences between the wait-list control and the intervention groups (H1), between the single-mode and combined conditions (H2), and between VM and VR (H3), we applied planned contrast analyses.
RESULTS: The planned contrasts showed that the VR condition significantly improved learning outcomes in comparison to the VM condition (H3). The decreased mean scores of the VM condition offset the increased mean scores of VR, and thus no significant differences could be found in H1 and H2.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides promising evidence that VR fosters medical communication competence more effectively than VM.
PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Medical students' learning in video-based digital environments can be facilitated by the use of interactive VR.},

	abstract = {Up to 56 million young and adult women of African origin suffer from Female Genital Schistosomiasis (FGS). The transmission of schistosomiasis happens through contact with schistosomiasis infested fresh water in rivers and lakes. The transmission vector is the snail that releases immature worms capable of penetrating the human skin. The worm then matures and mates in the blood vessels and deposits its eggs in tissues, causing urogenital disease. There is currently no gold standard for FGS diagnosis. Reliable diagnostics are challenging due to the lack of appropriate instruments and clinical skills. The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends "screen-and-treat" cervical cancer management, by means of visual inspection of characteristic lesions on the cervix and point-of-care treatment as per the findings. FGS may be mistaken for cervical cancer or sexually transmitted diseases. Misdiagnosis may lead to the wrong treatment, increased risk of exposure to other infectious diseases (human immunodeficiency virus and human papilloma virus), infertility and stigmatisation. The necessary clinical knowledge is only available to a few experts in the world. For an appropriate diagnosis, this knowledge needs to be transferred to health professionals who have minimal or non-existing laboratory support. Co-design workshops were held with stakeholders (WHO representative, national health authority, FGS experts and researchers, gynaecologists, nurses, medical doctors, public health experts, technical experts, and members of the public) to make prototypes for the WHO Pocket Atlas for FGS, a mobile diagnostic support tool and an e-learning tool for health professionals. The dissemination targeted health facilities, including remote areas across the 51 anglophone, francophone and lusophone African countries. Outcomes were endorsed by the WHO and comprise a practical diagnostic guide for FGS in low-resource environments.},

PURPOSE: This research aimed to explain students' experiences on the quality of interpersonal interactions in e-learning.
METHOD: This study was conducted from November 2021 to October 2022. The qualitative descriptive design via conventional content analysis was utilized. Purposeful and maximum variation methods recruited sixteen participants from three medical science universities in Iran. The data were collected through semi-structured, in-depth, face-to-face, or online interviews. Interviews were recorded through a digital recorder, and analysis was achieved simultaneously with data collection using Graneheim and Lundman (2004). The Lincoln and Guba criteria, including credibility, dependability, transferability, and confirmability, were used to improve the trustworthiness of the findings.
RESULTS: The results indicated the importance of different dimensions related to teaching-learning. It seems crucial to develop a comfortable and safe environment to improve interpersonal interactions. Educators should be provided with pedagogical skills to support interactions. In addition, focusing on some learners' soft skills is also vital. In addition to the significance of the teacher's inclusive role, the educational content must have critical standards. Constructive feedback and the proper use of simultaneous and non-simultaneous communication tools and social networks are other important issues in strengthening interpersonal relationships. Ultimately, comprehensive and ongoing support of learners improves the quality of interpersonal interactions.
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated the significance of different dimensions of teaching-learning as facilitating factors of interpersonal interactions. The proper use of simultaneous and non-simultaneous communication tools and social networks are other important issues in strengthening interpersonal relationships.

            Digitale Pflegetechnologien gewinnen in der Langzeitpflege zunehmend an Bedeutung. Sie umfassen alle Technologien, die mittels Vernetzung und/oder Sensorik Prozesse und/oder Produkte verändern, und schließen künstliche Intelligenz, also Verfahren, Methoden und Algorithmen, um mittels Daten zu lernen und darauf aufbauend zielorientierte Handlungen zu ermöglichen, ein. Ihre Anwendung reicht von der Förderung professioneller Zusammenarbeit über Steuerung und Verwaltung, Wissenserwerb und -weitergabe, Interaktion und Beziehung bis zur körpernahen Pflege.
            Digitale Pflegetechnologien haben das Potenzial, gleichzeitig die Qualität der Pflege zu erhöhen und die Arbeitsbedingungen in der Pflege zu verbessern. Allerdings stehen dem Hemmnisse auf verschiedenen Ebenen entgegen: Die Entwicklung dieser Technologien wird häufig von den technischen Möglichkeiten getrieben, sodass Produkte entstehen, die im Pflegealltag keinen konkreten Nutzen entfalten. Bei der Implementation wird nur die Bedienung geschult; es erfolgt aber keine Organisationsentwicklung zur systematischen Integration der Technologien in den Arbeitsalltag. Zudem fehlen hochwertige Evaluationen, die den tatsächlichen Nutzen im Arbeitsalltag abbilden, um so potenzielle Anwender:innen für die Technologie zu gewinnen. Schließlich ist die nachhaltige Finanzierung, insbesondere der Unterhaltung dieser Technologien, nicht gesichert.
            Eine gelingende Digitalisierung in der Pflege setzt daher voraus, dass Technikentwickler:innen und -anwender:innen ebenso wie Politik und Wissenschaft gemeinsam diese Hemmnisse überwinden. Das impliziert, dass Pflegende von Anfang an in den Entwicklungsprozess einbezogen sind, aber auch dass Orte geschaffen werden, in denen die Wirkung digitaler Pflegetechnologien im tatsächlichen Versorgungsgeschehen evaluiert werden kann.

            Abstract
            Digital care technologies are becoming increasingly important in long-term care. They encompass all technologies that change processes and products by means of networking and/or sensor technology and include artificial intelligence, that is, processes, methods, and algorithms for learning by means of data and enabling meaningful decisions based on this. Their application ranges from the promotion of professional collaboration, control and management, knowledge acquisition and transfer, interaction and relationships to physical caregiving.
            Digital care technologies have the potential to simultaneously increase the quality of care and improve working conditions in care. However, there are obstacles to this at various levels: The development of these technologies is often driven by technical possibilities, resulting in products that do not provide any concrete benefits in routine nursing care. During implementation, only the operator is trained; however, there is no organizational development for the systematic integration of these technologies into routine work. In addition, there is a lack of high-quality evaluations showing evidence of the actual benefits to routine work in order to attract potential users to these technologies. Finally, there is no sustainable financing, especially for the maintenance of these technologies.
            Successful digitization in long-term care therefore requires that technology developers and users, as well as policymakers and scientists, jointly overcome these obstacles. This implies that caregivers are involved in the development process from the outset (co-creation) but also that spaces are created where the effect of digital care technologies can be evaluated in routine caregiving.},

	abstract = {Crucial for organizations’ business performance, 21st-century digital skills have gained prominence. The Covid-19 pandemic’s impact on individuals, education, and higher education institutions led to a shift from traditional face-to-face to remote synchronous learning. Students experienced diverse information and communication technologies (ICTs), while instructors adapted course structures, engaged in e-learning, and revamped online curricula. This study examines factors affecting students’ digital skills acquisition, including instructor involvement, e-course quality, e-learning system usability, and e-course interactivity. Additionally, we explore the relationship between increased educational ICT usage and improved digital skills. Drawing from a survey of 624 higher education students in Pristina, Kosovo, and employing variance-based PLS-SEM analysis using SmartPLS 3.0, we find that active professor engagement in e-learning significantly influences digital skills acquisition. Ease of use and e-course interactivity also wield substantial effects, while e-course quality indirectly affects digital skills. Enhanced educational ICT usage positively correlates with creative and innovative skills development, enabled by content creation and ICT integration. This study contributes to the ongoing discussion regarding the potential enhancement of digital skills acquisition among higher education students. The findings indicate that increasing students’ gaining digital skills through e-learning is indeed achievable through instructor involvement, e-course quality, ease of use, and increased ICT utilization. This study’s insights provide a foundation for educators, institutions, and policymakers to make informed decisions on designing effective e-learning environments and strategies that promote students’ digital skills in a rapidly evolving educational landscape.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This review which aims to examine the recent and current status of pathology education in medical schools, and covers the publications related to undergraduate pathology education published between 2010 January and June 2023.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: A search was performed through PubMed, Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar, and Ulakbim search engines for the Science Citation Index, Science Citation Index Expanded, Emerging Sources Citation Index, Directory of Open Access Journals, Scopus, PubMed as well as TR Dizin indexed articles. The findings are categorized into two periods as 2010 January - 2020 April (pre-COVID-19 pandemic) and May 2020 - 2023 June. A total of 24 reviews/editorials/letters to the editor and 63 research articles in the pre-pandemic period and 11 reviews/ editorials/ letters to the editor and 35 research articles between 2020 May and 2023 June are included in the analysis.
RESULTS: Currently, medical education generally depends on core education programs with defined learning objectives and outcomes. Moreover, problem-based, case-based, and team-based interactive learning are being used along with traditional didactic courses. Additionally, digital/ web-based/remote education methods have gained prominence after the COVID-19 pandemic. The virtual or augmented reality and 3D drawing applications are offered as a solution for the autopsy and macroscopy courses. A scarce number of publications are found on measuring and evaluating the effectiveness of learning.
CONCLUSION: Artificial intelligence in pathology education is a topic that looks likely to become important in the near future. National and international comprehensive standardization is a necessity. A joint effort and collective intelligence are needed to achieve the desired goals in undergraduate pathology education.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Digital neuropsychological tools for diagnosing neurodegenerative diseases in the older population are becoming more relevant and widely adopted because of their diagnostic capabilities. In this context, explicit memory is mainly examined. The assessment of implicit memory occurs to a lesser extent. A common measure for this assessment is the serial reaction time task (SRTT).
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop and empirically test a digital tablet-based SRTT in older participants with cognitive impairment (CoI) and healthy control (HC) participants. On the basis of the parameters of response accuracy, reaction time, and learning curve, we measure implicit learning and compare the HC and CoI groups.
METHODS: A total of 45 individuals (n=27, 60\% HCs and n=18, 40\% participants with CoI-diagnosed by an interdisciplinary team) completed a tablet-based SRTT. They were presented with 4 blocks of stimuli in sequence and a fifth block that consisted of stimuli appearing in random order. Statistical and machine learning modeling approaches were used to investigate how healthy individuals and individuals with CoI differed in their task performance and implicit learning.
RESULTS: Linear mixed-effects models showed that individuals with CoI had significantly higher error rates (b=-3.64, SE 0.86; z=-4.25; P{\textless}.001); higher reaction times (F1,41=22.32; P{\textless}.001); and lower implicit learning, measured via the response increase between sequence blocks and the random block (β=-0.34; SE 0.12; t=-2.81; P=.007). Furthermore, machine learning models based on these findings were able to reliably and accurately predict whether an individual was in the HC or CoI group, with an average prediction accuracy of 77.13\% (95\% CI 74.67\%-81.33\%).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that the HC and CoI groups differed substantially in their performance in the SRTT. This highlights the promising potential of implicit learning paradigms in the detection of CoI. The short testing paradigm based on these results is easy to use in clinical practice.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Analogous to the situation in other disciplines, digital ENT teaching made significant progress during the pandemic. Most ENT clinics nationwide were able to offer a complete virtual teaching program in time. Innovative teaching methods were also used early on. This was recognized in student teaching evaluations. Due to the expansion of virtual reality (VR) in medical teaching, even greater satisfaction should be expected through improved teaching quality.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Surveys were performed with students (n = 180) of the ENT block internship in the summer semester of 2023. The aim of the evaluation was to determine the students' satisfaction with and subjective effectiveness of the newly implemented VR digital teaching method for teaching ear anatomy and coniotomy. A survey was also carried out among resident physicians.
RESULTS: The ENT teaching was perceived favorably by the students, with an average rating of 11.7 out of 15. The learning effectiveness and the value of VR in the ENT learning portfolio was evaluated varyingly by the students. The physicians' assessment was different, with a more positive perception.
CONCLUSION: Virtual reality represents an innovative component in the teaching portfolio of otolaryngology. This new teaching method is viewed and accepted as a future-oriented tool. Remarkably, the physicians involved voted consistently positively, while the students gave more critical assessments and pointed out limitations in the individual and subjective areas. These findings are in contrast to the further development of innovative teaching methods demanded by student interest groups.},

In terms of educational theory, the article addresses the question of how the visibility of patterns of the digital can affect and change the self-relation of individuals. Under circumstances in which the digital is a self-evident condition for accessing and understanding the world, in short, under post-digital circumstances, the inscription of world-relations into one’s own self-relations is not a purely passive process. Experiencing the digital – here as a quantified, collective experience – individuals can take responsibility for their own learning.},

	abstract = {Damit (angehende) Lehrkräfte digitale Medien zukünftig im Fachunterricht einsetzen, müssen sie im Rahmen des Lehramtsstudiums digitalisie-rungsbezogene Kompetenzen erwerben. Zwar beschreiben diverse Modelle solche Kompetenzen für die Lehrer*innenbildung, jedoch erweist es sich als Herausforderung, diese Kompetenzen in die Curricula universitärer Lehrveranstaltungen zu integrieren. Um Studium und Lehre in entsprechender Weise zu verändern, bedarf es eines Vorgehens, das nicht lediglich „top-down“-Steuerungsansätze des Change-Managements auf Hochschulen überträgt, sondern stattdessen deren organisationale Eigenheiten ernst nimmt und relevante Akteur*innen im Sinne eines „bottom-up“-Veränderungsprozesses einbezieht. Ein solches Vorgehen zur Veränderung universitärer Studienprogramme (im Sinne der Integration digitalisierungsbezogener Kompetenzen in Ausbildungsziele) wurde im Rahmen des Projekts „BiodigitaliS“ entwickelt. Dies erfolgte unter Bezug auf das Modell der Pädagogischen Hochschulentwicklung und unter Verwendung des Kompetenzrahmens „DiKoLAN“. Die Konzeption des Vorgehens sowie die Ergebnisse seiner Durchführung am Standort Leipzig werden im vorliegenden Beitrag beschrieben. Unter Berücksichtigung der Kontextbedingungen am Standort (Struktur und Organisation des Lehrangebots, Voraussetzungen und Bedarfe Studierender) und unter starkem Einbezug der Lehrenden konnten digitalisierungsbezogene Kompetenzen umfassender, gezielt und systematisch in die Ausbildungsziele bestehender biologiedidaktischer Lehrveranstaltungen integriert werden. Mit den formulierten Ausbildungszielen liefert das Vorgehen eine Grundlage für die Gestaltung und Evaluation von Hochschullehre zur Förderung digitalisierungsbezogener Kompetenzen. Vor dem Hintergrund der Ergebnisse wird im Beitrag ein Verfahren zur Integration digitalisierungsbezogener Kompetenzen in die Ausbildungsziele universitärer Lehre (IKAL-Verfahren) vorgestellt und anhand von Leitlinien für nachhaltige Veränderungen von Hochschullehre diskutiert. Abschließend erfolgt ein Ausblick auf die Übertragbarkeit des Verfahrens auf hochschulische Lehrveranstaltungen in anderen Bereichen.},

Self-regulated learning (SRL) is a fundamental requirement for achieving successful lifelong learning, and digitization is increasingly influential in this regard. This mixed-methods study explores the degree to which adaptive learning technology (ALT) can assist university students in their SRL with timely and personalized support. Additionally, the study examines how students perceive this feedback and incorporate it into their learning behavior. Using hierarchical linear modeling, we investigated the development of SRL over a 9-week period. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with purposively selected learners, based on stimulated recalls. The quantitative results demonstrate positive development in certain components of SRL. Furthermore, the results indicate that metacognitive activity can be partially predicted by motivational and emotional states. The qualitative findings reveal that learners have varying perceptions of feedback received from ALT and integrate it into their learning behaviors based on their individual benefits. The results support the assumption that feedback provided through educational technology must be precisely tailored to the needs of learners, taking into account the dynamics of their individual learning processes. The study contributes to the ongoing discussion on the design of educational technology.},

	abstract = {Utilizing digital healthcare services for patients who use wheelchairs is a vital and effective means to enhance their healthcare. Digital healthcare integrates various healthcare facilities, including local laboratories and centralized hospitals, to provide healthcare services for individuals in wheelchairs. In digital healthcare, the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) allows local wheelchairs to connect with remote digital healthcare services and generate sensors from wheelchairs to monitor and process healthcare. Recently, it has been observed that wheelchair patients, when older than thirty, suffer from high blood pressure, heart disease, body glucose, and others due to less activity because of their disabilities. However, existing wheelchair IoMT applications are straightforward and do not consider the healthcare of wheelchair patients with their diseases during their disabilities. This paper presents a novel digital healthcare framework for patients with disabilities based on deep-federated learning schemes. In the proposed framework, we offer the federated learning deep convolutional neural network schemes (FL-DCNNS) that consist of different sub-schemes. The offloading scheme collects the sensors from integrated wheelchair bio-sensors as smartwatches such as blood pressure, heartbeat, body glucose, and oxygen. The smartwatches worked with wearable devices for disabled patients in our framework. We present the federated learning-enabled laboratories for data training and share the updated weights with the data security to the centralized node for decision and prediction. We present the decision forest for centralized healthcare nodes to decide on aggregation with the different constraints: cost, energy, time, and accuracy. We implemented a deep CNN scheme in each laboratory to train and validate the model locally on the node with the consideration of resources. Simulation results show that FL-DCNNS obtained the optimal results on the sensor data and minimized the energy by 25\%, time 19\%, cost 28\%, and improved the accuracy of disease prediction by 99\% as compared to existing digital healthcare schemes for wheelchair patients.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Given the re-emergence of coal workers' pneumoconiosis in Appalachia and Mountain West United States, there is a tremendous need to train rural professionals in its multidisciplinary management. Since 2016, the Miners' Wellness TeleECHO (Extension for Community Health Outcomes) Program held by the University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, and Miners' Colfax Medical Center, Raton, New Mexico, provides structured longitudinal multidisciplinary telementoring to diverse professionals taking care of miners by creating a digital community of practice. Program sessions emphasize active learning through discussion, rather than didactic training. Professional stakeholder groups include respiratory therapists, home health professionals, benefits counselors, lawyers or attorneys, clinicians, and others. Rural-urban differences in knowledge transfer in such a community of practice, however, remain unknown.
OBJECTIVE: We aim to evaluate the role of the rurality of the patient or client base in the transfer of knowledge to professionals caring for miners using the digital community of practice approach.
METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study of 70 professionals participating in the Miners' Wellness TeleECHO Program between 2018 and 2019. Drawing insights from social network analysis, we examined the association between the rurality of participants' patient or client base and their self-reported receipt of knowledge. Our focal independent variable was the respondent's self-reported percentage of patients or clients who reside in rural areas. We measured knowledge transfer sources by asking participants if they received knowledge regarding the care of miners during and outside of TeleECHO sessions from each of the other participants. Our dependent variables included the number of knowledge sources, number of cross-stakeholder knowledge sources, number of same stakeholder knowledge sources, and range and heterogeneity of knowledge sources.
RESULTS: Respondents, on average, identified 4.46 (SD 3.16) unique knowledge sources within the community, with a greater number of cross-stakeholder knowledge sources (2.80) than same stakeholder knowledge sources (1.72). The mean knowledge source range was 2.50 (SD 1.29), indicating that, on average, respondents received knowledge sources from roughly half of the 5 stakeholder groups. Finally, the mean heterogeneity of knowledge sources, which can range between 0 and 0.80, was near the midpoint of the scale at 0.44 (SD 0.30). Multivariable analyses revealed that as the rurality of patient or client bases increased, participants reported more knowledge sources overall, more knowledge sources from outside of their stakeholder groups, a higher knowledge source range, and greater heterogeneity of knowledge sources (P{\textless}.05 for all comparisons).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that participants who serve rural areas especially benefit from knowledge transfer within the TeleECHO community of practice. Additionally, the knowledge they receive comes from diverse information sources, emphasizing its multidisciplinary nature. Our results underscore the capacity of the TeleECHO model to leverage technology to promote rural health equity for miners.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multicentre training could reduce biases in medical artificial intelligence (AI); however, ethical, legal, and technical considerations can constrain the ability of hospitals to share data. Federated learning enables institutions to participate in algorithm development while retaining custody of their data but uptake in hospitals has been limited, possibly as deployment requires specialist software and technical expertise at each site. We previously developed an artificial intelligence-driven screening test for COVID-19 in emergency departments, known as CURIAL-Lab, which uses vital signs and blood tests that are routinely available within 1 h of a patient's arrival. Here we aimed to federate our COVID-19 screening test by developing an easy-to-use embedded system-which we introduce as full-stack federated learning-to train and evaluate machine learning models across four UK hospital groups without centralising patient data.
METHODS: We supplied a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B preloaded with our federated learning software pipeline to four National Health Service (NHS) hospital groups in the UK: Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (OUH; through the locally linked research University, University of Oxford), University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust (UHB), Bedfordshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (BH), and Portsmouth Hospitals University NHS Trust (PUH). OUH, PUH, and UHB participated in federated training, training a deep neural network and logistic regressor over 150 rounds to form and calibrate a global model to predict COVID-19 status, using clinical data from patients admitted before the pandemic (COVID-19-negative) and testing positive for COVID-19 during the first wave of the pandemic. We conducted a federated evaluation of the global model for admissions during the second wave of the pandemic at OUH, PUH, and externally at BH. For OUH and PUH, we additionally performed local fine-tuning of the global model using the sites' individual training data, forming a site-tuned model, and evaluated the resultant model for admissions during the second wave of the pandemic. This study included data collected between Dec 1, 2018, and March 1, 2021; the exact date ranges used varied by site. The primary outcome was overall model performance, measured as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Removable micro secure digital (microSD) storage was destroyed on study completion.
FINDINGS: Clinical data from 130 941 patients (1772 COVID-19-positive), routinely collected across three hospital groups (OUH, PUH, and UHB), were included in federated training. The evaluation step included data from 32 986 patients (3549 COVID-19-positive) attending OUH, PUH, or BH during the second wave of the pandemic. Federated training of a global deep neural network classifier improved upon performance of models trained locally in terms of AUROC by a mean of 27·6\% (SD 2·2): AUROC increased from 0·574 (95\% CI 0·560-0·589) at OUH and 0·622 (0·608-0·637) at PUH using the locally trained models to 0·872 (0·862-0·882) at OUH and 0·876 (0·865-0·886) at PUH using the federated global model. Performance improvement was smaller for a logistic regression model, with a mean increase in AUROC of 13·9\% (0·5\%). During federated external evaluation at BH, AUROC for the global deep neural network model was 0·917 (0·893-0·942), with 89·7\% sensitivity (83·6-93·6) and 76·6\% specificity (73·9-79·1). Site-specific tuning of the global model did not significantly improve performance (change in AUROC {\textless}0·01).
INTERPRETATION: We developed an embedded system for federated learning, using microcomputing to optimise for ease of deployment. We deployed full-stack federated learning across four UK hospital groups to develop a COVID-19 screening test without centralising patient data. Federation improved model performance, and the resultant global models were generalisable. Full-stack federated learning could enable hospitals to contribute to AI development at low cost and without specialist technical expertise at each site.

	abstract = {We proposed a new deep learning (DL) model for accurate scatter correction in digital radiography. The proposed network featured a pixel-wise water equivalent path length (WEPL) map of subjects with diverse sizes and 3D inner structures. The proposed U-Net model comprises two concatenated modules: one for generating a WEPL map and the other for predicting scatter using the WEPL map as auxiliary information. First, 3D CT images were used as numerical phantoms for training and validation, generating observed and scattered images by Monte Carlo simulation, and WEPL maps using Siddon's algorithm. Then, we optimised the model without overfitting. Next, we validated the proposed model's performance by comparing it with other DL models. The proposed model obtained scatter-corrected images with a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 44.24 ± 2.89 dB and a structural similarity index measure of 0.9987 ± 0.0004, which were higher than other DL models. Finally, scatter fractions (SFs) were compared with other DL models using an actual phantom to confirm practicality. Among DL models, the proposed model showed the smallest deviation from measured SF values. Furthermore, using an actual radiograph containing an acrylic object, the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of the proposed model and the anti-scatter grid were compared. The CNR of the images corrected using the proposed model are 16\% and 82\% higher than those of the raw and grid-applied images, respectively. The advantage of the proposed method is that no actual radiography system is required for collecting training dataset, as the dataset is created from CT images using Monte Carlo simulation.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) literacy is at the top of the agenda for education today in developing learners' AI knowledge, skills, attitudes and values in the 21st century. However, there are few validated research instruments for educators to examine how secondary students develop and perceive their learning outcomes. After reviewing the literature on AI literacy questionnaires, we categorized the identified competencies in four dimensions: (1) affective learning (intrinsic motivation and self-efficacy/confidence), (2) behavioural learning (behavioural commitment and collaboration), (3) cognitive learning (know and understand; apply, evaluate and create) and (4) ethical learning. Then, a 32-item self-reported questionnaire on AI literacy (AILQ) was developed and validated to measure students' literacy development in the four dimensions. The design and validation of AILQ were examined through theoretical review, expert judgement, interview, pilot study and first- and second-order confirmatory factor analysis. This article reports the findings of a pilot study using a preliminary version of the AILQ among 363 secondary school students in Hong Kong to analyse the psychometric properties of the instrument. Results indicated a four-factor structure of the AILQ and revealed good reliability and validity. The AILQ is recommended as a reliable measurement scale for assessing how secondary students foster their AI literacy and inform better instructional design based on the proposed affective, behavioural, cognitive and ethical (ABCE) learning framework. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic AI literacy has drawn increasing attention in recent years and has been identified as an important digital literacy. Schools and universities around the world started to incorporate AI into their curriculum to foster young learners' AI literacy. Some studies have worked to design suitable measurement tools, especially questionnaires, to examine students' learning outcomes in AI learning programmes. What this paper adds Develops an AI literacy questionnaire (AILQ) to evaluate students' literacy development in terms of affective, behavioural, cognitive and ethical (ABCE) dimensions. Proposes a parsimonious model based on the ABCE framework and addresses a skill set of AI literacy. Implications for practice and/or policy Researchers are able to use the AILQ as a guide to measure students' AI literacy. Practitioners are able to use the AILQ to assess students' AI literacy development.},

	abstract = {This article investigates the many variables that impact the adoption of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) in the Indian higher education sector. A MOOC is similar to a tool for offering educational materials via an online platform to a sizable number of students around the world with the potential of receiving education from the best schools. In 2008, MOOCs were established and attained momentum in 2012 as a popular learning tool (Biswas \& Sarkar, 2020). At present, the enrolment of students in MOOCs has grown tremendously. After the USA, India is leading the universal outgrowth in student engagement (Reddy, 2020). Observing the enhancement of enrolment in the higher education sector and also fulfilling the demands of the students, India has launched different project programme for offering MOOC courses in Higher education. At present, platforms such as NPTEL (2003), mooKIT (2014), IITBombayX (2016), and SWAYAM are used in India to offer MOOC courses (2016). MOOCs have played a major role in increasing the Gross Enrolment Ratio in the field of Higher Education (Banwari, 2018). A key issue that Indian higher education is currently grappling with is the lack of coordination and its application to various economic sectors. However, these problems are eradicated by the MOOC programme because maximum courses of the MOOCs are related to industry demand and needs. In this article, conceptual and technical descriptions of different MOOC platforms are provided along with their components and features. The present study also attempts to explain why MOOCs are so necessary in countries like India and what are the benefits and challenges for the implementation of MOOCs. MOOCs in countries like India provide lifelong opportunities to learn and work together. In a large nation such as India, MOOCs promote the idea of inclusive, lifelong learning.},

	abstract = {Im Frühjahr 2020 kam es zum ersten Lockdown in der Corona-Pandemie, demzufolge an Hochschulen vollständig auf digitale Lehre umgestellt wurde. In der Ausbildung von Sportlehrkräften war in den Umstellungsformaten curricular verankerte Fachpraxis zu berücksichtigen. Entsprechend wurde ein Online-Bewegungsformat entworfen, das 21 Sportlehramtsstudierende zu einer vierwöchigen Lauf-Aktivität aufforderte. Der Schwerpunkt der forschungsbezogenen Analyse lag auf der Prüfung des Einflusses der Maßnahme auf die Persönlichkeit der Teilnehmenden. Erstens war von Interesse, ob durch die Laufintervention das Befinden stabilisiert oder verbessert werden konnte. Es wurde das körperliche, psychische und soziale Befinden fokussiert. Zweitens wurden interaktive Zusammenhänge von Sport und Digitalisierung vor dem Hintergrund eines mit digitaler Lehre intensivierten Studienalltags analysiert. Zur Exploration wurden Daten aus kriteriengeleiteten Dokumentationen zur Laufintervention mit Antworten aus einer qualitativen Online-Befragung zusammengeführt. Für die empirische Analyse wurden beide Erhebungstechniken kombiniert, indem das überwiegend qualitative Material (qualitative Inhaltsanalyse; Mayring, 2015) mithilfe quantifizierbarer Häufigkeiten (SPSS) interpretiert wurde. Bei den Befragten hat das Joggen das körperliche und das psychische Befinden positiv beeinflusst. Auch kann Sport soziale Entbehrungen über einen gewissen Zeitraum abmildern, das Risiko der Vereinsamung bleibt auf Dauer bestehen. Positive Wirkungen auf die Persönlichkeit werden im Wechselverhältnis zwischen Laufen ohne Hilfsmittel und der daraus resultierenden besseren Körperwahrnehmung erkannt. Allerdings reagiert die Mehrheit der Teilnehmenden trotz reflexiv positiv konnotierter Körpererlebnisse nicht mit einem dauerhaften Verzicht auf digitale Technologien. Reduziert die intensivierte digitale Lehre körperliche Aktivitäten, so wirkt sich dies negativ auf das physische und psychische Befinden aus. Vice versa können sich intensivierte Sportaktivitäten positiv auf das Lernverhalten in digital gesteuerten Theoriefächern auswirken. Explizite Handlungsempfehlungen wurden aus sportpädagogischer Sicht auf bevorstehende Herausforderungen und mit Verweisen auf Persönlichkeitsbildung transferiert. (DIPF/Orig.)},

At the same time, knowledge and skills are at risk of leaving the ship with the retiring Boomer generations. Using the Austrian federal administration as an example, this book identifies and analyses the challenges and solutions that can be found in practice in this regard. However, one-sided efforts to retain and transfer knowledge run the risk of putting themselves at a disadvantage when it comes to innovation. Instead of a carefully nurtured ‘legacy of the analogue world of administration’, what is needed is a strategic approach to what smart organisational learning and ‘unlearning’ need to be like in times of demographic change and digital transformation.},

	abstract = {Vor dem Hintergrund aktueller gesellschaftlicher Entwicklungen und globaler Herausforderungen gewinnt die Bildung für nachhaltige Entwicklung an Bedeutung und rückt auch in Schulen als zentralen Bildungseinrichtungen zunehmend in den Vordergrund. Wesentliches Ziel schulischer Förderung ist dabei, junge Menschen nachhaltig zur gemeinwohlorientierten Gestaltung unserer Zukunft zu befähigen. Voraussetzung dafür ist, dass Schüler:innen ihre Potenziale zur Selbst- und Mitbestimmung, zu Kollaboration, Kommunikation, Kooperation und Kreativität entwickeln und entfalten können. Dazu bedarf es einer Diagnostik und Förderung individueller Fähigkeits- und Persönlichkeitspotenziale durch adaptive innovative Lernarchitekturen. In den Kongressbänden zum 7. Münsterschen Bildungskongress mit dem Titel „Potenziale erkennen – Talente entwickeln – Bildung nachhaltig gestalten“ werden Forschungsansätze und Förderkonzepte zur langfristigen Potenzial- und Talententwicklung von Schüler:innen mit dem Themenkomplex der nachhaltigen Bildung verknüpft. Die Kongressbände gliedern sich in die Schwerpunkte Begabungsforschung und Begabungsförderung. Dieser erste Band Beiträge aus der Begabungsforschung startet mit thematischen Beiträgen zu individueller und diversitätssensibler Begabungsdiagnostik und -entwicklung. Es folgen Artikel aus den Bereichen digitales Lernen, Schul- und Unterrichtsentwicklung in Theorie und Praxis, sowie Lehrer:innenprofessionalisierung. Den Abschluss bildet ein Kapitel mit Beiträgen, die sich mit neuen Wegen in der Begabungsforschung und -förderung zur Gestaltung der Zukunft beschäftigen.},

Activities/tasks/pedagogical practices involved social reading/DSR, social annotation, annotating texts, collaborative reading, and enhancement of reading comprehension, and all studies had positive outcomes for DSR applications. (3) The theories and conceptual foundations for exploring DSR were related to reading, the social aspect of reading, and the digital environment of DSR. Conclusions drawn from the analysis of the data are used to make recommendations in terms of pedagogical practices using DSR to enhance learning and teaching for L2 learners and to highlight theoretical frameworks and areas of research in DSR for educators and researchers.},

	abstract = {Blood vessel segmentation in medical imaging is one of the essential steps for vascular disease diagnosis and interventional planning in a broad spectrum of clinical scenarios in image-based medicine and interventional medicine. Unfortunately, manual annotation of the vessel masks is challenging and resource-intensive due to subtle branches and complex structures. To overcome this issue, this paper presents a self-supervised vessel segmentation method, dubbed the contrastive diffusion adversarial representation learning (C-DARL) model. Our model is composed of a diffusion module and a generation module that learns the distribution of multi-domain blood vessel data by generating synthetic vessel images from diffusion latent. Moreover, we employ contrastive learning through a mask-based contrastive loss so that the model can learn more realistic vessel representations. To validate the efficacy, C-DARL is trained using various vessel datasets, including coronary angiograms, abdominal digital subtraction angiograms, and retinal imaging. Experimental results confirm that our model achieves performance improvement over baseline methods with noise robustness, suggesting the effectiveness of C-DARL for vessel segmentation.Our source code is available at https://github.com/boahK/MEDIA\_CDARL.2.},

Evidence underscores a strong need for digital health ELSI training, yet little is known about the specific ELSI topic areas that researchers and practitioners would most benefit from learning. To identify ELSI educational needs, a needs assessment survey was administered to the members of the Society of Behavioral Medicine (SBM). We sought to identify areas of ELSI proficiency and training need, and also evaluate interest and expertise in ELSI topics by career level and prior ELSI training history. The 14-item survey distributed to SBM members utilized the Digital Health Checklist tool (see recode.health/tools) and included items drawn from the four-domain framework: data management, access and usability, privacy and risk to benefit assessment. Respondents (N = 66) were majority faculty (74.2\%) from psychology or public health. Only 39.4\% reported receiving "formal" ELSI training. ELSI topics of greatest interest included practices that supported participant engagement, and dissemination and implementation of digital tools beyond the research setting. Respondents were least experienced in managing "bystander" data, having discussions about ELSIs, and reviewing terms of service agreements and privacy policies with participants and patients. There is opportunity for formalized ELSI training across career levels. Findings serve as an evidence base for continuous and ongoing evaluation of ELSI training needs to support scientists in conducting ethical and impactful digital health research.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In 2017, Ireland pioneered a unique response to the worsening epidemiology of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE), declaring a national public health emergency. Subsequently, CPE mitigation guidelines and policies were implemented in acute hospitals, focused on patient screening and outbreak management, often by healthcare workers (HCWs) with limited background in infection prevention and control (IPC). CPE risks from sinks and drains remain inadequately controlled.
AIMS: To compare CPE awareness, perceptions of the role of the environment in CPE transmission, and disposal practices of liquid waste from clinical handwashing sinks between IPC HCWs and non-IPC HCWs in Ireland.
METHODS: Between December 2022 and March 2023, HCWs employed in acute hospitals in Ireland between 2017 and 2022 were invited to participate anonymously in a 30-question digital survey.
FINDINGS: Responses (N=283) were received across several clinical disciplines. In total, 21.6\% of respondents were working or had previously worked in IPC roles, 84.1\% of whom reported no IPC-related learning needs. In comparison with non-IPC HCWs, more IPC HCWs perceived a risk of pathogen transmission from clean water plumbing (68.9\% vs 39.2\%; P{\textless}0.001) and waste/drainage plumbing (81.2\% vs 43.7\%; P{\textless}0.001). Among nursing and medical staff, only 5.6\% of IPC HCWs used clinical handwashing sinks for disposal of liquid waste, compared with 60\% of non-IPC HCWs (P{\textless}0.001). In comparison with non-IPC HCWs, a greater proportion of IPC HCWs reported that they had witnessed colleagues routinely discarding liquid waste (including nutritional products, antimicrobials and patient body fluids) via clinical handwashing sinks (88.9\% vs 77.9\%) CONCLUSIONS: Although there is general awareness of the role of the built environment in pathogen transmission, including CPE, familiarity with sink/water-related transmission is greater among IPC HCWs. There may be opportunities to improve disposal practices for liquid waste through education targeting non-IPC HCWs.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Learning surgical skills is an essential part of neurosurgical training. Ideally, these skills are acquired to a sufficient extent in an ex vivo setting. The authors previously described an in vitro brain tumor model, consisting of a cadaveric animal brain injected with fluorescent agar-agar, for acquiring a wide range of basic neuro-oncological skills. This model focused on haptic skills such as safe tissue ablation technique and the training of fluorescence-based resection. As important didactical technologies such as mixed reality and 3D printing become more readily available, the authors developed a readily available training model that integrates the haptic aspects into a mixed reality setup.
METHODS: The anatomical structures of a brain tumor patient were segmented from medical imaging data to create a digital twin of the case. Bony structures were 3D printed and combined with the in vitro brain tumor model. The segmented structures were visualized in mixed reality headsets, and the congruence of the printed and the virtual objects allowed them to be spatially superimposed. In this way, users of the system were able to train on the entire treatment process from surgery planning to instrument preparation and execution of the surgery.
RESULTS: Mixed reality visualization in the joint model facilitated model (patient) positioning as well as craniotomy and the extent of resection planning respecting case-dependent specifications. The advanced physical model allowed brain tumor surgery training including skin incision; craniotomy; dural opening; fluorescence-guided tumor resection; and dura, bone, and skin closure.
CONCLUSIONS: Combining mixed reality visualization with the corresponding 3D printed physical hands-on model allowed advanced training of sequential brain tumor resection skills. Three-dimensional printing technology facilitates the production of a precise, reproducible, and worldwide accessible brain tumor surgery model. The described model for brain tumor resection advanced regarding important aspects of skills training for neurosurgical residents (e.g., locating the lesion, head position planning, skull trepanation, dura opening, tissue ablation techniques, fluorescence-guided resection, and closure). Mixed reality enriches the model with important structures that are difficult to model (e.g., vessels and fiber tracts) and advanced interaction concepts (e.g., craniotomy simulations). Finally, this concept demonstrates a bridging technology toward intraoperative application of mixed reality.},

	doi = {10.1001/jamadermatol.2023.5550},
	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: The development of artificial intelligence (AI)-based melanoma classifiers typically calls for large, centralized datasets, requiring hospitals to give away their patient data, which raises serious privacy concerns. To address this concern, decentralized federated learning has been proposed, where classifier development is distributed across hospitals.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether a more privacy-preserving federated learning approach can achieve comparable diagnostic performance to a classical centralized (ie, single-model) and ensemble learning approach for AI-based melanoma diagnostics.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multicentric, single-arm diagnostic study developed a federated model for melanoma-nevus classification using histopathological whole-slide images prospectively acquired at 6 German university hospitals between April 2021 and February 2023 and benchmarked it using both a holdout and an external test dataset. Data analysis was performed from February to April 2023.
EXPOSURES: All whole-slide images were retrospectively analyzed by an AI-based classifier without influencing routine clinical care.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) served as the primary end point for evaluating the diagnostic performance. Secondary end points included balanced accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.
RESULTS: The study included 1025 whole-slide images of clinically melanoma-suspicious skin lesions from 923 patients, consisting of 388 histopathologically confirmed invasive melanomas and 637 nevi. The median (range) age at diagnosis was 58 (18-95) years for the training set, 57 (18-93) years for the holdout test dataset, and 61 (18-95) years for the external test dataset; the median (range) Breslow thickness was 0.70 (0.10-34.00) mm, 0.70 (0.20-14.40) mm, and 0.80 (0.30-20.00) mm, respectively. The federated approach (0.8579; 95\% CI, 0.7693-0.9299) performed significantly worse than the classical centralized approach (0.9024; 95\% CI, 0.8379-0.9565) in terms of AUROC on a holdout test dataset (pairwise Wilcoxon signed-rank, P {\textless} .001) but performed significantly better (0.9126; 95\% CI, 0.8810-0.9412) than the classical centralized approach (0.9045; 95\% CI, 0.8701-0.9331) on an external test dataset (pairwise Wilcoxon signed-rank, P {\textless} .001). Notably, the federated approach performed significantly worse than the ensemble approach on both the holdout (0.8867; 95\% CI, 0.8103-0.9481) and external test dataset (0.9227; 95\% CI, 0.8941-0.9479).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this diagnostic study suggest that federated learning is a viable approach for the binary classification of invasive melanomas and nevi on a clinically representative distributed dataset. Federated learning can improve privacy protection in AI-based melanoma diagnostics while simultaneously promoting collaboration across institutions and countries. Moreover, it may have the potential to be extended to other image classification tasks in digital cancer histopathology and beyond.},

	abstract = {The accurate detection of brain tumors through medical imaging is paramount for precise diagnoses and effective treatment strategies. In this study, we introduce an innovative and robust methodology that capitalizes on the transformative potential of the Swin Transformer architecture for meticulous brain tumor image classification. Our approach handles the classification of brain tumors across four distinct categories: glioma, meningioma, non-tumor, and pituitary, leveraging a dataset comprising 2,870 images. Employing the Swin Transformer architecture, our method intricately integrates a multifaceted pipeline encompassing sophisticated preprocessing, intricate feature extraction mechanisms, and a highly nuanced classification framework. Utilizing 21 matrices for performance evaluation across all four classes, these matrices provide a detailed insight into the model's behavior throughout the learning process, furthermore showcasing a graphical representation of confusion matrix, training and validation loss and accuracy. The standout performance parameter, accuracy, stands at an impressive 97\%. This achievement outperforms established models like CNN, DCNN, ViT, and their variants in brain tumor classification. Our methodology's robustness and exceptional accuracy showcase its potential as a pioneering model in this domain, promising substantial advancements in accurate tumor identification and classification, thereby contributing significantly to the landscape of medical image analysis.},

	abstract = {The exponential growth of data across various medical domains has generated a substantial demand for techniques to analyze multimodal big data. This demand is particularly pronounced in fields such as computational pathology due to the diverse nature of the tissue. Cross-modal retrieval aims to identify a common latent space where different modalities, such as image-text pairs, exhibit close alignment. The primary challenge, however, often lies in the representation of tissue features. While language models can be trained relatively easily, visual models frequently struggle due to the scarcity of labeled data. To address this issue, the innovative concept of harmonization has been introduced, extending the learning scheme distillation without supervision, known as DINO. The harmonization of scale refines the DINO paradigm through a novel patching approach, overcoming the complexities posed by gigapixel whole slide images in digital pathology. Experiments conducted on diverse datasets have demonstrated that the proposed approach significantly enhances cross-modal retrieval in tissue imaging. Moreover, it exhibits vast potential for other fields that rely on gigapixel imaging.},

Many scientific training programs quickly adapted to virtual formats by incorporating digital assets developed for virtual learning and remote social engagement. At the outset, the value of continuing digital elements with future in-person events was unclear. To examine how virtual resources supported heterogeneous professional training programs, we reviewed survey data for a 14-year-old training program for scientific professionals titled Isotope Tracers in Metabolic Research: Principles and Practice of Kinetic Analysis. We found a positive relationship between survey satisfaction and the post-pandemic, in-person program that included digital assets held in 2022 when compared to pre-pandemic in-person programs. To better understand the post-pandemic program satisfaction, we assessed the 2021 virtual course format and survey data. We found that although there was a desire to return to in-person programs, the digital assets and approaches were valued. In examining the individual programmatic elements in the 2022 in-person course, there was better "value and understandability" of lectures over previous in-person years. These findings highlight how incorporating new digital engagement strategies for professional development benefit even the most established programs in supporting heterogeneous learners.},

On the one hand, this use offers opportunities for teachers to practice assessment more effectively, and on the other hand, it brings challenges to the design of pedagogically sound and responsible digital assessment. There is a lack of validated instruments and models that explain, assess and support teachers' critical pedagogical practice of digital assessment. This explorative work first develops and validates a survey instrument to examine teachers' digital assessment practices. Secondly, we build a model to investigate to what extent teachers' pedagogical digital assessment knowledge is a foundation for the future of digital assessment (ie, authentic, accessible, automated, continuous and responsible).

	abstract = {Mastery-based assignments typically provide students with multiple opportunities to improve their performance, but getting students to take advantage of these opportunities is difficult. We report on the implementation of a two-part series of nudges designed to improve students' engagement with and performance on mastery-based assignments in high-enrollment, introductory undergraduate courses. Students received one or two email-based nudges for each assignment, providing both decision information and decision assistance. Delivered via email by a digital coaching system that provides tailored support to students, we evaluated the effectiveness of viewing versus not viewing these personalized nudges across introductory courses in mathematics, computer science and engineering over five terms at our large, research-intensive university. We used multilevel modelling with a sample of 30,693 assignment scores nested within 79 assignments and 5349 undergraduate students to explore the relationship between students' viewing the nudges and their scores while controlling for performance in other courses and students' baseline proclivities to read email from the coaching system. We find that viewing versus not viewing nudges is significantly related to improved outcomes. Viewing the first of the two-part nudge series is associated with a 3\% increase in scores on average. Importantly, we found a significant interaction with prior academic performance such that students with the lowest average academic performance across all courses are predicted to benefit the most—up to 9\%—from nudging. Positive impacts are observed in most courses where nudges were implemented and are found to be most impactful for later versus earlier assignments within a term. We discuss the implications of these results for supporting students' decision-making within mastery-based assignment schemes and suggest future research for tailored nudges to support student success. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Nudges are known to be broadly effective, but heterogeneity is observed especially in education where the research base is relatively limited. Mastery-based grading is an alternative approach to grading that, among other features, emphasizes learning through an explicit feedback cycle of struggle and revision without penalty. What this paper adds This study assesses the effectiveness of personalized nudges in the context of mastery-based grading in undergraduate STEM courses. We examined the efficacy of viewing versus not viewing nudges in the real learning settings of three STEM courses enrolling more than 5000 students. We found the nudges to be effective overall, correlated with improvements of approximately 3\% in students' assignment scores and most impactful for students with the lowest average academic performance. Implications for practice and/or policy Nudging by email or text message has a low overhead cost and yet may provide materially significant gains in students' assessment scores. Nudges can be effectively targeted to specific subsets of students and tailored based on students' prior and concurrent learning analytics data.},

	abstract = {Virtual contexts play a crucial role in assisting students' learning. Researchers have taken advantage of the potential of immersive virtual reality (VR) for situating students in inaccessible places, and for engaging them in learning activities. Meanwhile, several previous studies have reported that, in VR-based learning contexts, students' perception of immersion and learning motivation could be low owing to the lack of clear objectives and problem-solving scenarios. On the other hand, digital game-based learning is capable of enhancing students' engagement in a task. In this study, we designed a learning approach (namely RPG-VR) by means of integrating a role-playing game with VR technology to enhance students' science learning. Furthermore, a quasi-experiment was conducted to evaluate the students' learning effectiveness via, respectively, providing the RPG-VR learning approach and the conventional VR (called C-VR) learning approach for the experimental and control groups. The experimental results indicated that this approach significantly enhanced the students' perceptions of immersion, self-efficacy and extrinsic learning motivation, in comparison with the C-VR learning approach. Specifically, students who learned with the RPG-VR learning approach perceived more immersion in the engagement and the total immersion stages. This study contributes to existing knowledge of VR technology by providing that a digital role-playing game could reinforce the main characteristics of VR-based learning environments and enhance students' concentration on a learning task. However, no significant difference was found between the two groups in terms of promoting students' learning achievements, implying that more instructional assistance is needed to improve students' knowledge gains in VR-based learning environments. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Virtual contexts play a crucial role in promoting students' learning performances. Virtual reality has been adopted for situating students in inaccessible places to promote their learning. A DGBL context provides students with opportunities for learning that emphasize immersion in practice, resulting in concept acquisition and skill development. What this paper adds An RPG-VR learning approach was designed by means of integrating a role-playing game with VR technology to enhance students' science learning. A virtual reality learning system with a role-playing game was developed based on the proposed approach. This approach significantly enhanced the students' perceptions of self-efficacy, extrinsic learning motivation and immersion, especially in the engagement and the total immersion stages. A digital role-playing game could reinforce the main characteristics of VR-based learning environments. Implications for practice and/or policy The RPG-VR learning approach could be a notable reference for further research on VR-based learning environments. More instructional assistance is needed to improve students' knowledge gains in VR-based learning environments.},

A total of 180 parents of children with special needs from various regions of Turkey participated in the study. This study was conducted using a relational screening model. Data were collected using digital parenting awareness, attitude and self-efficacy perception scales and analysed using descriptive and correlational statistical methods. The findings revealed that parents had moderate levels of awareness, positive attitudes and self-efficacy perceptions regarding digital parenting, but these variables showed significant differences according to the disability status of the children. In particular, parents of children with learning disabilities had higher digital parenting awareness than parents of other disability groups. In addition, a positive and significant relationship was found between parents' digital parenting awareness, attitudes and self-efficacy perception. The findings of this study are important and contribute to both the practical and theoretical perspectives. In applicable terms, this study revealed the needs and expectations of parents of children with special needs regarding digital parenting. Theoretically, this is a rare study that examines the situation and experiences of parents with children with special needs in digital parenting.

	abstract = {Spatial perspective-taking (SPT) ability positively influences performance in STEM fields. While limited research studies have been done with school students, they have yielded inconclusive findings and, hence, here we report findings from our study with an augmented reality (AR) enhanced learning environment (ARELE), GeoSolvAR, on middle-school students' SPT ability. We conducted a sequential explanatory mixed-method study with 90 students to test GeoSolvAR's twin features of augmented systems and inquiry-based activities. The study had one experimental (n = 30) and two control groups (n = 30 × 2), where students were individually administered an online pre- and posttest to measure their SPT ability. The experimental group worked with both the features of GeoSolvAR, while the control group worked with only the AR feature or had no intervention. Our findings reveal that the experimental group showed significant improvement in SPT ability while students in the control groups showed non-significant improvement or no change. Furthermore, we found that all experimental group students used certain body movements and imagined shifts in spatial positions while solving the activity questions. Thus, we conjecture that GeoSolvAR affords thinking and imagining with the body which makes it a potent tool for improving students' SPT ability. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Spatial perspective taking (SPT) belongs to a set of spatial abilities that have been shown to positively influence academic success and career success in STEM fields. Augmented reality systems with their ability to augment 2D images into 3D forms are being explored mostly in college and above levels to improve SPT ability. Limited research investigating the improvement of SPT in school students has used VR digital games or robots. These have either yielded inconclusive findings or not found any improvement in school students' SPT abilities. What this paper adds Conclusive evidence for improving SPT ability in middle-school students. Empirical evidence for a design to effectively combine augmenting abilities of AR systems with inquiry-based learning scaffolds to improve the SPT ability of middle-school students. A conjecture about the mechanism by which middle-school children's spatial perspective taking improves when scaffolded with an Augmented Reality Enhanced Learning Environment (ARELE) tool. Implications for practice and policy Practitioners such as teachers may directly use GeoSolvAR (the ARELE tool) to help middle-school students improve their spatial perspective-taking abilities. Researchers from the fields of both technology-enhanced learning and science education may use the findings to design improved AR tools and test their impact on students' SPT ability. This work can serve as the basis for further investigating the effect of improved SPT ability on students' performance in STEM subjects. Our work provides support for embodied cognition being used as a strategy for solving SPT tasks. The identification of specific head and hand movements (gestures) can be further probed to understand the exact mechanism of how the ARELE mediates students' performance on the SPT tasks.},

	abstract = {In recent years, AI technologies have been developed to promote students' self-regulated learning (SRL) and proactive learning in digital learning environments. This paper discusses a comparative study between generative AI-based (SRLbot) and rule-based AI chatbots (Nemobot) in a 3-week science learning experience with 74 Secondary 4 students in Hong Kong. The experimental group used SRLbot to maintain a regular study habit and facilitate their SRL, while the control group utilized rule-based AI chatbots. Results showed that SRLbot effectively enhanced students' science knowledge, behavioural engagement and motivation. Quantile regression analysis indicated that the number of interactions significantly predicted variations in SRL. Students appreciated the personalized recommendations and flexibility of SRLbot, which adjusted responses based on their specific learning and SRL scenarios. The ChatGPT-enhanced instructional design reduced learning anxiety and promoted learning performance, motivation and sustained learning habits. Students' feedback on learning challenges, psychological support and self-regulation behaviours provided insights into their progress and experience with this technology. SRLbot's adaptability and personalized approach distinguished it from rule-based chatbots. The findings offer valuable evidence for AI developers and educators to consider generative AI settings and chatbot design, facilitating greater success in online science learning. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic AI technologies have been used to support student self-regulated learning (SRL) across subjects. SRL has been identified as an important aspect of student learning that can be developed through technological support. Generative AI technologies like ChatGPT have shown potential for enhancing student learning by providing personalized guidance and feedback.

The study provides evidence that ChatGPT can enhance students' science knowledge, motivation and SRL compared to a rule-based AI chatbot. The study offers insights into how ChatGPT can be used as a tool to facilitate SRL and promote sustained learning habits. Implications for practice and/or policy The findings of this study suggest that educators should consider the potential of ChatGPT and other generative AI technologies to support student learning and SRL. Educators and students should be aware of the limitations of AI technologies and ensure that they are used appropriately to generate desired responses.

In particular, we develop a combined analysis that takes into account both the quantity of students’ interventions and their social modes of co-construction. This analysis has revealed two main macro-categories of collaborative processes activated by the groups of students who participated in the study, which mainly differ in the level of sharing and comparison within the groups and in the aim that guided their work.},

	abstract = {Digitalization can potentially benefit the creative and cognitive development of children. This study aims to analyze this impact on a sample of preschool children. A total of 80 preschoolers were divided into four groups based on their age and program variables: there were two groups (control and training) of children aged 3 to 4 years and two groups (control and training) of children aged 5 to 6 years. The study uses the following data collection tools: the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking (TTCT) Figural Form A and the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI-IV). The digital intervention involved participating in a specially designed digitally-enhanced learning course entitled “Preschoolers: Digital Adventures”. Both training groups exhibited a statistically higher level of creative thinking compared to baseline, as evidenced by TTCT-A scores. The younger training group also had significantly higher scores on all WPPSI-IV subscales, while their peers in the control group failed to show such a result. Older controls significantly improved on all except one WPPSI-IV subscale, i.e., Fluid Reasoning Index subscale, while their peers in the training group scored higher on all WPPSI-IV subscales without exception. The present findings suggest that digital enhancement of the learning process in preschool education can help improve certain aspects of creative and cognitive development. The results can be used by educators and parents to integrate digital tools, applications and activities into preschool curricula.},

	abstract = {Pre-recorded lectures have become a prevalent approach in online education due to the proliferation of MOOC platforms and the COVID-19 pandemic. However, due to the lack of real-time interactions between instructors and learners, learners have encountered various difﬁculties in understanding the lectures and actively engaging with the learning materials. Therefore, various attempts have been made to aid learning by revealing the cues of the instructor, including countenance, digital pointer, and gaze, in video lectures. Nevertheless, the current body of research still lacks a comprehensive exploration of these non-verbal cues, critical for understanding and enhancing the learning experience. Consequently, recent studies on visualization even with novel cues often fail to match the learners’ needs. Therefore, in this paper, we explore the impact of instructors’ non-verbal cues, focusing on the countenance, digital pointer, and gaze, in video lectures and introduce a novel gaze visualization called Elements-aware Gaze. First, we determine learners’ design preferences and optimize design parameters for Elements-aware Gaze. Afterward, we analyze the usability, workload, and cognitive load of non-verbal cues in video lectures through a user study with 37 subjects. The ﬁndings highlight the practicality of the Digital Pointer and the effectiveness of Elements-aware Gaze, recognized for its utility and engaging learning experience while minimizing the workload in video lectures. Finally, our results emphasize the importance of thoughtful design and strategic integration of non-verbal cues in video lectures, providing a valuable foundation for enhancing remote learning experiences in the evolving online education landscape.},

Current studies mainly explored the immediate impact of forced remote learning on academic performance and practical skills. However, there was an underexplored area concerning the effect on recent college graduates’ perceived employability and work readiness. This study aims to address this gap, focusing on the Philippines context. Responses from 131 recent college graduates were analyzed, revealing that the forced shift to remote learning significantly contributed to perceived employability (­R2 = 0.453) and work readiness (­R2 = 0.440). However, examining the demographic profile variables did not substantially influence these outcomes in the hierarchical regression model. This research underscores the critical role of remote learning in shaping career readiness and challenges educators and policymakers to rethink strategies for integrating it into the broader educational framework, offering a lens to understand its long-term impacts on higher education outcomes.},

This study aims to assess whether the use of a non-specialist digital tool, such as Microsoft Forms, might be able overcome limitations in current assessment procedures and ultimately provide a more effective method for marking and feedback provision for an OSCE. Results from OSCE examiners (N = 8) and students (N = 30) who participated in the pilot indicate that Microsoft Forms does have the potential to provide a more effective experience for examiners and ultimately improve upon feedback provision for students when compared with a paper-based marking tool.

	abstract = {A key commitment of computer-supported collaborative learning research is to study how people learn in collaborative settings to guide development of methods for capture and design for learning. Computer-supported collaborative learning research has a tradition of studying how the physical world plays a part in collaborative learning. Within the field, a material turn is emerging that considers how digital and tangible technologies actively contribute to collaborative learning processes. Studying how tangible materials produce collaborative learning visibly and algorithmically is particularly important at a time when advanced algorithms are integrated into educational contexts in ways that are not always transparent. However, the needed methodologies for capturing how non-human agents take part in collaborative learning remains underdeveloped. The present study builds on current CSCL research that investigates materials in collaborative learning and introduces posthumanist perspectives with the aim to decenter humans methodologically and to probe empirically whether and how these perspectives contribute to empirical understanding of collaborative learning processes. Taking fiber crafts (e.g., weaving and fabric manipulation) as a context for computational learning, the present study conducted a posthumanist analysis of differences among human and non-human participants in collaboration using video data to investigate how middle school youths and fiber craft components performed algorithms over time. The findings show how both youths and craft materials actively contributed to the performance of algorithms. In weaving, algorithms became repeated youth-material movements one dimension at a time. In fabric manipulation, algorithms became a repeated confluence of component parts. Decentering humans through an analysis of differences among human and non-human introduced human-material collaboration as a productive unit of analysis for understanding how materials and people together contribute to producing what can be recognized as computational performance. The findings of this research contribute to ongoing conversations in CSCL research on how computational materials can be considered in collaborative learning and present a new approach to capture collaborative learning as physical expansion over time. The study has implications for future research on capturing collaborative computational learning and designing physical computational learning opportunities that show technology as evolving.},

This qualitative case study generated data from pre-service language teacher interactions in 2022 during projects with digital platforms such as VoiceThread, Canvas, Zoom, Google Meet; Google classroom; and WhatsApp. A survey focusing on preservice teachers’ ICT utilization was analyzed as well as the professors’ perspectives on the tasks. Investigating this experience provided an understanding of student perspectives (challenges \& benefits) on ICT that instructors required as well as technologies students chose to utilize to collaborate on projects. Findings indicated that while the benefits stood out, facing and learning how to deal with the challenges was important for preservice teachers to develop certain attitudes in their professional lives, such as agency, leadership, and autonomy. Instructors also found they need to attend to important considerations for Internet availability, adequate time for collaboration in synchronous and asynchronous formats, targeted scaffolding to learn new technologies, and to continue the preferred and motivating option for preservice teachers to choose technologies.},

Recently, novel approaches in technology-enabled learning utilizing virtual reality (VR) instead of traditional multimedia materials, digital learning games, and educational software. The use of VR technologies in language education improves creativity, interactivity, collaboration, problem-solving, and active knowledge building. In addition, the benefits of using VR in language education extend to lower elementary grades. Young learners can greatly benefit from the immersive and engaging nature of VR technology when learning English. By incorporating VR into English education, students in these grades can experience a more interactive and stimulating learning environment. This study examined which constructs affect students’ continuous use of VR by applying the Technology Acceptance Theory (TAM) theory and explored whether and how VR can improve students’ abilities to learn English compared to voice-video-based oral communications. The results have academic and practical implications, as they provide guidance for a rigorous aspect of technology-enhanced learning and demonstrate strong evidence that VR is more effective than traditional education methods. This supports educators and researchers in developing VR materials and activities. This study emphasized the advantages and potentials of VR in language education.},

This study adopts a mixed-methods approach, supplementing quantitative questionnaires with qualitative data from semi-structured interviews. There were eight STEM and four non-STEM lecturers from an established private university in Malaysia who volunteered for this study. Data from the semi-structured interviews were analysed using the codebook analysis as a form of thematic analysis. To this end, the seating arrangement in a classroom may indicate to students how information should be trans­ mitted, informal gatherings build social bonds and teaching and grades may affect collaboration. In relation to the five constructs of SIT, we suggest the CPC (Cohesiveness, Participation, Collaboration) active learn­ ing framework for considering the interplay of the three spaces men­ tioned within the evolving pedagogies and the learning process. Specifically, cohesiveness which sits at the core of the framework, pro­ vides a pivotal support for the other two dimensions, that is, participation and collaboration.},

	abstract = {While the positive role of engagement in students’ learning achievements has been well documented, limited studies have examined whether or how learner engagement would vary with their achievements over time, especially within an unstructured digital learning context. This paper using a purposive sampling method reported an exploratory study on how English as a foreign language (EFL) undergraduate students with lower and upper proficiency levels (LP and UP) behaviorally engaged in their self-initiated mobile-assisted English learning (MAEL) beyond the classroom. Participants were senior-year undergraduate students from universities in central China. Quantitative analysis based on 409 questionnaires showed that there were significant differences in both how long and how often students participated in MAEL across proficiency levels, with LP learners investing more time on a more frequent basis than UP learners. However, there was no significant effect of language proficiency on the number of students’ MAEL resources employed. Besides, EFL proficiency was also found to play a mediating role in students’ learning preferences despite their common interest in receptive learning practices. Qualitative data from 36 follow-up semi-structured interviews revealed students’ cognitive and emotional rationales behind these learning behaviors. This study might offer some fresh insight into the complexity of foreign language learner engagement with selfinitiated mobile-assisted learning in Chinese higher education.},

	abstract = {Teaching and learning in higher education have increasingly become digitalized and associated with innovative pedagogical methodologies over the past decades. Following the sudden onset of the pandemic in March 2020, several studies tended to focus on traditional students' experiences with emergency remote education while literature is scarce on non-traditional students (or adult learners) pedagogical experiences in Distance Education contexts. Using a qualitative case study approach, this study explored how digital technologies mediated instructors' and adult learners' educational experiences during COVID-19 and their first-time experiences with blended learning. Between October 2021 and July 2022, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 40 adult learners and 20 instructors in three selected public higher education institutions (HEIs) in Ghana. Data analysis followed Braun and Clarke's (2012) thematic analysis approach. The results showed that the transition to blended learning was supported by the adoption and integration of varied virtual online technologies. The themes highlight the positive and negative impacts of technology in mediating the educational experiences of instructors and adult learners in blended learning environments. The themes which reflected both instructors' and adult learners' experiences were enhanced course delivery and pedagogy, competency development, technological issues and poor-quality pedagogy. Blended learning facilitated by technology could be the ‘new normal learning’ post-pandemic for adult learners pursuing Distance Education in Ghana. The study recommends the implementation of agile strategies and policies by HEIs to ensure sustainable quality education in distance learning. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated the adoption of innovative pedagogical approaches in higher education contexts. Technological transformations in information and communication technology (ICT) have enhanced remote teaching in higher education institutions globally. The educational experiences of educators and learners differ in blended learning contexts. What this paper adds Instructors and adult learners' positive experiences with navigating a variety of web-based technologies during the educational process are negatively impacted by technological difficulties during online instruction. Participants' experiences of blended learning are mixed with a preference for face-to-face dimension of blended learning instead of the online dimension. The paper identifies four themes that characterize instructors and adult learners' experiences with technology-enhanced learning including enhanced course delivery and pedagogy, competency development, technological issues and poor-quality pedagogy. Implications for practice and/or policy The study provides evidence-based information on the relevance of digitizing distance education for sustainable development and promotion of lifelong learning opportunities for distance education students. The research recommends that higher education institutions (HEIs) implement agile policies to facilitate a seamless shift to distance learning. HEIs may adopt open distance learning frameworks to streamline 21st century pedagogical and learning practices in distance-blended learning environments for quality course instruction. The study highlights the potential distance learning modalities that HEIs can consider for Distance Education students to sustain effective quality teaching and learning.},

	abstract = {Critical thinking (CT) is among the core abilities students need to acquire to overcome the unprecedented and ever-changing challenges of the 21st century and beyond. To facilitate the attainment of CT, numerous researchers worldwide have conducted empirical studies focusing on leveraging computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) to improve students’ CT. Notwithstanding the existence of empirical studies, meta-analyses that clearly show the overall effect sizes (ESs) of the impacts are wanting. The current meta-analysis aimed at filling this lacuna by examining 30 empirical studies that were conducted between the years 2014 and 2023, stored in databases such as Scopus, the Web of Science, ERIC and Google Scholar, and search engines such as Google and Ecosia and that met the inclusion criteria. The study included journal articles, conference papers and student theses. The total number of participants in the studies was 2,980, representing 11 countries. The results indicated that CSCL was an effective instructional approach to foster students’ CT with statistically significant levels of overall ES estimates (ES = 0.859, z = 8.55, p {\textless} .001, 95\% CI [0.661–1.055]). The results also indicated that there was no apparent evidence of publication bias (Egger’s regression = 0.478, p {\textgreater} .05). Instructional activities, technology usage, participants’ level of education, dimensions of CT, intervention duration and sample size were found to significantly moderate the overall ES estimate. Based on the results, recommendations are made regarding effective ways to use digital technology and collaborative learning for honing students’ CT.},

              Hintergrund
              Ziel dieser Arbeit ist die Darstellung der aktuellen Studienlage zur Prävalenz und Ausprägung von Technostresserleben in der stationären medizinischen Versorgung in deutschen und schweizerischen Kliniken. Dieses stellt ein aufkommendes Risiko im Zusammenhang mit dem zunehmenden Einsatz von Informations- und Kommunikationstechnologien (IKT) im Gesundheitswesen dar.
            
            
              Methodik
              Mithilfe einer systematischen Literaturrecherche wurden unter Verwendung von Schlüsselbegriffen vordefinierten Ein- und Ausschlusskriterien 49 Artikel identifiziert, von denen 9 Studien einbezogen worden sind.
            
            
              Ergebnisse
              Theoretische Grundlage der in dieser Arbeit analysierten Studien bildet überwiegend das Technostress-Konzept von Ragu-Nathan et al. (2008) mit den Subkategorien Techno-overload, Techno-complexity, Techno-insecurity, Techno-uncertainty und Techno-invasion. Bei fast allen Studien handelt es sich um Querschnittsstudien, welche sich auf die Ausprägung von Technostress unter Ärzt:innen, seltener Pfleger:innen und anderen Gesundheitsberufen konzentriert haben sowie auf die Analyse der auslösenden und abschwächenden Faktoren von Technostress und Auswirkungen auf organisationale und gesundheitsbezogene Outcomes (u. a. Produktivität, Arbeitszufriedenheit, Burnout). Die aktuelle Studienlage spricht hierbei für ein moderates Level von Technostress, wobei die höchsten Ausprägungen für die Subkategorien „Techno-overload“ und „Techno-uncertainty“ erhoben worden sind.
            
            
              Schlussfolgerung
              Ärzt:innen und Pfleger:innen zeigen die höchsten Ausprägungen von Technostresserleben, gefolgt von Medizinisch-technischen, Medizinisch-therapeutischen und anderen Berufen (z. B. Sozialarbeiter:innen, Psycholog:innen, Hebammen). Es mangelt jedoch an empirischen Studien zu nichtärztlichen Gesundheitsberufen sowie an Interventionsstudien, die insbesondere Coping-Strategien im Umgang mit arbeitsbezogenem Technostresserleben evaluieren und darauf basierende Handlungsempfehlungen für Gesundheitsorganisationen aussprechen.

            Abstract
            
              Background
              The aim of this review article is to present the current state of research on the prevalence and severity of technostress experience in inpatient medical care in German and Swiss hospitals. This is an emerging risk among healthcare personnel in hospitals in connection with the increasing use of information and communication technologies (ICT) in healthcare.
            
            
              Methods
              A systematic literature search was carried out using key terms and predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria identified 49 articles, of which 9 studies were included.
            
            
              Results
              The theoretical basis of the studies analyzed in this article is predominantly the technostress concept of Ragu-Nathan et al. (2008) with the subcategories techno-overload, techno-complexity, techno-insecurity, techno-uncertainty and techno-invasion. Almost all studies are cross-sectional in nature that focused on the extent of technostress among physicians, less frequently among nurses and other healthcare professions as well as on the analysis of the triggering and mitigating factors of technostress and effects on organizational and health-related outcomes (including productivity, job satisfaction, burnout). The current study situation indicates a moderate level of technostress, with the highest levels recorded for the subcategories techno-overload and techno-uncertainty.
            
            
              Conclusion
              Physicians and nurses show the highest levels of technostress, followed by medical technical, medical therapeutic and other professions (e.g., social workers, psychologists, midwives); however, there is a lack of empirical studies on nonmedical healthcare professions as well as interventional studies that particularly evaluate coping strategies in dealing with work-related technostress and make recommendations for action for healthcare organizations based on this.},

Analyses have been focused on identifying the determinants of student’s engagement levels and revealing the impacts of behavioral sequences and cognitive sequences on student’s engagement levels. The results show that (1) instructional strategies, classroom behaviors, and cognitive states were significant predictors of students’ on-task rate; (2) the continuity of classroom behaviors improved the ontask rate; and (3) the standard deviations of attention and cognitive load were positively correlated with the on-task rate.

Tablets – zu analysieren. Es zeigt sich, dass die Schulen sehr unterschiedliche Maßnahmen umsetzen, die als mehr oder weniger erfolgreich wahrgenommen werden. Aus den empirischen Ergebnissen wird ein Tätigkeitsprofil für eine*n Schulentwicklungsmanager*in abgeleitet. Zentrale Aufgabe des Schulentwicklungsmanagements ist die Koordination und Planung des Implementationsprozesses an der Schule. Dies soll sicherstellen, dass Maßnahmen (z. B. Fortbildungen, Beschaffung von digitalen Geräten) aufeinander abgestimmt und zielführend sind.},

	abstract = {Welche Bedingungen für die Selbstentwicklung ändern sich durch die Digitalisierung, möglicherweise beschleunigt durch die derzeitige Pandemie? Gibt es nachweisbare Effekte? Nehmen heteronome Einflüsse zu? Die Möglichkeiten einer datengestützten Selbstformung und Selbstdarstellung haben sich vervielfacht und werden offenbar millionenfach genutzt. Unter Verweis auf die impliziten Aspekte des Selbst werden hierfür aber Grenzen aufgezeigt. Poppers Drei-Welten-Theorie (Popper, 2015, 263ff) wird herangezogen, um die Beziehungen zwischen virtueller Realität und materieller Welt abzubilden, und es wird behauptet, die Zunahme von Objekten der Welt 3 habe sich beschleunigt. Unter Bezug auf die phänomenologischen Arbeiten von Thomas Fuchs (2020) wird die These herausgearbeitet, dass die Digitalisierung Prozesse der Entleiblichung vorantreibt, welche die Persönlichkeitsentwicklung gefährden. Es wird aber auch gezeigt, dass Gegenbewegungen einer Verleiblichung empirisch belegbar sind. Im Hinblick auf die sich rasch ausbreitende Kultur der Selbstdarstellung und Selbstinszenierung durch das Selfie in sozialen Netzwerken wird gefragt, ob dies überwiegend heteronomen Interessen dient oder auch ein Potential für die kreative Entwicklung und Erweiterung des Spielraums für das Selbst enthält. Als Kriterien für eine empirische Überprüfung von Effekten der Nutzung digitaler Medien werden exemplarisch Seelische Gesundheit, Selbstwertgefühl und Selbstwirksamkeit sowie die Fähigkeit zum Flowerleben genannt und aktuelle Ergebnisse internationaler Studien über Veränderungen in Zeiten der Pandemie referiert. Im Hinblick auf die niemals abgeschlossenen Bemühungen um eine Selbstoptimierung werden kritische Positionen von Seiten der Erziehungswissenschaft und ihrer Bezugsdisziplinen referiert, aber auch darauf verwiesen, dass hier intrinsische Motivationen anzunehmen sind, die schon vor der Digitalisierung und der Verwendung von Big Data Menschen dazu angetrieben haben, sich im Hinblick auf internale und soziale Bezugsnormen selbst körperlich und seelisch auszuformen und gezielt zu entwickeln, bis hin zu einer resilienten Haltung dem Tod gegenüber.

	abstract = {Die Basis des Beitrags bildet die qualitative Studie „Ich Zocke“, in der die Belastungen und Bewältigungsstrategien Adoleszenter während der Pandemie unter Fokussierung auf das Computerspielen untersucht wurden. Adoleszente gelten im Zuge einer Pandemie entwicklungsbedingt als vulnerable Gruppe, die dementsprechend besonders unter den Auswirkungen der Maßnahmen zu deren Eindämmung leiden (Kaman et al., 2021). Während der Corona-Pandemie stieg der Spielkonsum von Adoleszenten seit Beginn der Krise, wie aktuelle Studien nachweisen (YouGov, 2020). In der Studie „Ich Zocke“ wurden vor diesem Hintergrund 15 Adoleszente im Alter von 11 bis 21 Jahren mittels einer Kombination aus narrativen und problemzentrierten Interviews zu ihrem Erleben der Pandemie in Zusammenhang mit ihrem Computerspielverhalten zwischen Juni und Juli 2021 interviewt. In welcher Hinsicht Computerspiele als Möglichkeitsräume für Entwicklung, Veränderung und Bildungsanlässe (Fromme, Jörissen \& Unger, 2008; Fromme \& Könitz, 2014; Fritz, 2009) in Zeiten einer Krise gelten können sowie die Frage, welche zusätzlichen Belastungen mit dem Computerspielen einhergehen, werden in dem geplanten Beitrag diskutiert. Dabei verstehen wir Computerspiele als Erfahrungsräume (Mittlböck, 2020), die das Potenzial zur Formung und Umformung der Art und Weise, wie wir uns und unsere Welt wahrnehmen (Fromme \& Könitz, 2014), beinhalten.

Dabei wird u. a. verdeutlicht, warum Reflexion grundlegend für den persönlichkeitsbildenden Anteil des Professionalisierungsprozesses ist (Schön, 1983). Gerade mit Blick auf die verstärkten Digitalisierungsforderungen im Studium ist dabei auch die digital unterstützte Reflexionsanregung zu thematisieren. Im Rahmen von zwei BMBF geförderten Qualitätsoffensive Lehrerbildung Projekten wurde an der Universität Vechta seit 2016 ein digitales Portfolio-Tool entwickelt, das aktuell implementiert und evaluiert wird. Das Tool verfolgt insbesondere das Ziel der Reflexion eigener Lern- und Entwicklungsprozesse und dient damit dem Professionalisierungsprozess (Bauer, 2012). In diesem Beitrag wird nach einer theoriegeleiteten Betrachtung digitaler Reflexionsförderung zur Unterstützung professionsbezogener Persönlichkeitsbildung auf die Methode Portfolioarbeit (u.a. Bräuer, 2014) eingegangen. Abschließend werden Gelingensbedingungen und Grenzen reflexionsfördernder elektronischer Portfolioarbeit zur Unterstützung der Persönlichkeitsbildung angehender Lehrkräfte verdeutlicht.

This applies not only to classical literature but also to children's literature and picture books, as well as various media such as radio plays, films, and even video games. Instances of deceptive narration repeatedly occur, or it becomes clear only gradually that the described events could not have happened as presented. Even exhibitions can address or stage deception, illusion, and unreliability. Pedagogically, this opens up opportunities to stimulate literary learning, introduce aesthetic experiences, and promote critical media literacy. This volume examines the phenomenon of unreliable narration for the first time from a transmedia and didactic perspective. It explores various media and their characteristics, offers systematic extensions of the possibilities for describing reliability and unreliability, and develops concrete didactic models and positions of this phenomenon in the digital age.},

	abstract = {The application of machine learning (ML) has grown and is now used to enhance learning outcomes. In blended classroom settings, ML, emerging smartphones and wearable technologies are commonly used to improve teaching and learning. The combination of these advanced technologies and ML plays a crucial role in enhancing real-time feedback quality. However, there are abundant scopes of improvement and strong need for further careful investigations in this area. We propose an MLbased intelligent real-time feedback system to address current research challenges for blended classrooms. The proposed system provides real-time feedback to students and teachers. We build an Android application for our intelligent feedback interfaces. The user interfaces use students’ academic performance prediction models with real-time states and dynamic feedback timings based on historic feedback statistics. In addition, the feedback scheduling algorithms, choices of peripheral devices for real-time feedback, and feedback modalities to optimize fatigue make our system interfaces intelligent and novel. The end users well-received the intelligent features and technology of the proposed system. Our empirical findings indicate that unique design elements, such as dynamic timing, choice of peripheral devices, and modalities of real-time feedback, are crucial in integrating the system with blended classes. The intelligent characteristics of the proposed system have been appreciated by a large proportion of the end-users (90.90\% of teachers and 84.21\% of students) for use in real-time blended classroom environments. The higher comparative system usability scale (SUS) scores with benchmarks show real promise of the system design.},

              The widespread use of video games has raised concerns about their potential negative impact on mental well-being. Nevertheless, the empirical evidence supporting this notion is largely based on correlational studies, warranting further investigation into the causal relationship. Here we identify the causal effect of video gaming on mental well-being in Japan (2020–2022) using game console lotteries as a natural experiment. Employing approaches designed for causal inference on survey data (
              n
               = 97,602), we found that game console ownership, along with increased game play, improved mental well-being. The console ownership reduced psychological distress and improved life satisfaction by 0.1–0.6 standard deviations. Furthermore, a causal forest machine learning algorithm revealed divergent impacts between different types of console, with one showing smaller benefits for adolescents and females while the other showed larger benefits for adolescents. These findings highlight the complex impact of digital media on mental well-being and the importance of considering differential screen time effects.},

The theory-practice seminar “Counseling language learners” in a blended learning environment includes the teaching of counseling competencies, followed by actual online counseling sessions with school students. As a further approximation of practice, before gathering their ﬁrst experience as counselors, preservice teachers play through a virtual simulation of a counseling session in which they can interactively control the counselor’s behavior by choosing from a pool of alternatives. In this way, users learn inductively about the functionality of conversational techniques, and begin to anticipate the consequences of their actions. An evaluative study explores the beneﬁts perceived by preservice teachers of the present VGS application. Results indicate high levels of usability and utility of the VGS as well as an aroused situational and topic interest through the task. Conﬁrmatory evaluations are still required.},

	abstract = {Digitale Medienkompetenzen werden als Kulturtechnik betrachtet, die den traditionellen Kanon aus Lesen, Schreiben, Rechnen ergänzt und verändert. Somit stellen sie für den Sprach- und insbesondere den Deutschunterricht einen relevanten Unterrichtsgegenstand dar. Die Reflexion über Praktiken digitaler Alltagskommunikation ist stets auch ein Nachdenken über situative Bedingungen und sprachliche Angemessenheit. Die linguistische Analyse und Modellierung digitaler Praktiken schafft die Voraussetzungen, digitalen Sprachgebrauch kompetent analysieren, differenziert beurteilen und selbständig produzieren zu können. Die Vermittlung nötiger Kompetenzen im Sinne von Digital Literacies stellt eine schulische Herausforderung dar. Der Beitrag fokussiert Medienkompetenzen in der digitalen Welt, indem Digital Literacies auf aktuelle KMK-Strategien zu Medienbildung in Deutschland bezogen und durch das Konzept der funktionalen Angemessenheit erweitert werden. Auf der Basis von Schulbuchanalysen und der Konzeption einer exemplarischen Unterrichtssequenz wird gezeigt, wie die Reflexion über Sprachgebrauch in digitalen Medien didaktisch umgesetzt werden kann und welche hochschuldidaktischen Konsequenzen daraus erwachsen.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has garnered significant attention for its pivotal role in the national security and health care sectors. However, its utilization in military medicine remains relatively unexplored despite its immense potential. AI operates through evolving algorithms that process extensive datasets, continuously improving accuracy and emulating human learning processes. Generative AI, a type of machine learning, uses algorithms to generate new content, such as images, text, videos, audio, and computer code. These models employ deep learning to encode simplified representations of training data and generate new work resembling the original without being identical. Although many AI applications in military medicine are theoretical, the U.S. Military has implemented several initiatives, often without widespread awareness among its personnel. This article aims to shed light on two resilience initiatives spearheaded by the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is now the Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office. These initiatives aim to enhance commanders’ dashboards for predicting troop behaviors and develop models to forecast troop suicidality. Additionally, it outlines 5 key AI applications within military medicine, including (1) clinical efficiency and routine decision-making support, (2) triage and clinical care algorithms for large-scale combat operations, (3) patient and resource movements in the medical common operating picture, (4) health monitoring and biosurveillance, and (5) medical product development. Even with its promising potential, AI brings forth inherent risks and limitations that require careful consideration and discussion. The article also advocates for a forward-thinking approach for the U.S. Military to effectively leverage AI in advancing military health and overall operational readiness.},

	abstract = {Due to its task-based, gamified, and interactive features, unplugged programming activity has been widely employed in education and teaching as an activity away from electronic screens and other digital devices. There is ongoing debate over how to help K-9 pupils develop their computational thinking through unplugged programming activities. Based on findings from 15 experimental and quasi-experimental studies conducted domestically and abroad between 2006 and 2023, this study adopts meta-analysis to quantitatively analyze the influence of unplugged programming activities on K-9 students’ computational thinking, focusing on an in-depth analysis of variables such as different students’ grade, gender, experimental period, research discipline, and unplugged programming activities categories. The results show that unplugged programming activity has a positive effect on the computational thinking of K-9 students (Hedges’ g = .631, 95\% CI .463, .799, P {\textless} .001), and its promotion effect is affected by the variables such as students’ grade, learning time, subjects studied, and unplugged programming activities categories. Based on the conclusions of the meta-analysis, this paper proposes several suggestions. For example, it suggests paying attention to the cultivation of computational thinking among middle school students, and mastering the appropriate timing for unplugged programming activities to avoid the plateau effect. Additionally, it recommends strengthening the integration of unplugged programming activities across different disciplines, as well as promoting the use of storytelling and collaborative unplugged programming activities in the classroom.},

	abstract = {Adaptive learning technologies are closely related to learners' self-regulatory processes in individual and collaborative learning. This study presents the outcomes of a systematic literature review of empirical evidence on adaptive learning environments to foster self-regulation and shared regulation of learning in collaborative settings. We provide an overview of what and how adaptive technologies have been used to understand and promote self-regulated learning in collaborative contexts. A search resulted in 38 papers being analysed. Specifically, we identified the seven main objectives (feedback and scaffolding, self-regulatory skills and strategies, learning trajectories, collaborative learning processes, adaptation and regulation, self-assessment, and help-seeking behaviour) that the adaptive technology research has been focusing on. We also summarize the implications derived from the reviewed papers and frame them within seven thematic areas. Finally, this review stresses that future research should consider developing a converging theoretical framework that would enable concrete monitoring and support for self-regulation and socially shared regulation of learning. Our findings set a baseline to support the adoption and proliferation of adaptive learning technology within self-regulated learning research and development. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic By providing personalized and learner-centric adaptive learning environments (ADLEs), adaptive learning technology can support and foster self-regulated learning (SRL) practices. It is possible to create a more student-centred and effective learning environment by combining adaptive learning and collaborative learning. Socially shared regulatory activities can involve planning, monitoring, controlling and reflecting on a group's learning processes. What this paper adds Provides a systematic literature review of empirical evidence on ADLEs, SRL and socially shared regulation of learning (SSRL) in collaborative contexts. Summarizes the insights on (S)SRL through ADLEs in collaborative learning. Identifies challenges and opportunities for ADLEs to support (S)SRL in collaborative learning. Implications for practice and/or policy Learning analytics and educational technology researchers will be able to use the systematic review as a guide for future research. Learning analytics and educational technology practitioners will be able to use the systematic review as a summary of the field's current state.},

Video-based face-to-face courses have proven their worth in training the professional vision of teaching quality features such as classroom management in teacher education. However, individually adaptable mastery learning offers enable a more effective consideration of different learning requirements and the provision of speciﬁc feedback. Therefore, a digital, video-based and individually adaptable learning module for promoting the professional vision and self-efﬁcacy beliefs about classroom management was developed (mastery learning offer) and compared to a digital, videobased seminar concept that was traditionally conducted by lecturers at ﬁxed times in a group context (uniﬁed learning offer). 121 student teachers participated in the quasi-experimental pre–post–follow-up study and analyzed classroom managementrelated events with the mastery learning offer (n = 49), with the uniﬁed learning offer (n = 39) or were part of an untreated control group (n = 33). Analyses of longitudinal growth curve models showed that, compared to the control group, both video-based formats contributed to signiﬁcantly higher latent increases in professional vision of classroom management, with the mastery learning group performing best. With regard to classroom management-related self-efﬁcacy beliefs, there were increases in the intervention groups, but these did not differ signiﬁcantly from the control group. The article provides important starting points for examining video-based teaching formats that address student’s heterogeneity and the digitization as challenges for teacher education.},

Durch Verknüpfung mit den physischen, medialen und virtuellen Lebensräumen der Schüler:innen verfügen digitale Medien über Gegenwarts- und insbesondere auch über Zukunftsbedeutung für die Heranwachsenden. Die didaktisch-methodische Reflexion und Bewertung von technologischen Innovationen aus dem Internet of Things (IoT) oder der Industrie 4.0 ermöglichen, grundlegende Aussagen zu fächerspezifischen sowie fächerübergreifenden Potenzialen eines Einsatzes im schulischen Kontext zu formulieren. In diesem Beitrag werden die Potenziale für ein gelingendes Lehren und Lernen in der naturwissenschaftlichen Bildung von digitalen Zwillingen zusammenfassend betrachtet. Digitale Zwillinge sind bereits in der industriellen Prozessentwicklung und -optimierung implementiert. Hierbei zeigen die in digitalen Zwillingen repräsentierten Vernetzungsstrukturen zwischen digitaler und realer Welt besonders deren Potenzial in den Bereichen künstliche Intelligenz, maschinelles Lernen und Data-Mining-Prozessen. Um Bildungsperspektiven für den naturwissenschaftlichen Unterricht abzuleiten, werden die eingehenden und ausgehenden Datenstrukturen und deren technologische Funktionsweisen in digitalen Zwillingen näher betrachtet. Der Beitrag thematisiert den Blick auf digitale Zwillinge als intelligente neue Bildungstechnologie in Lehr-Lern-Prozessen, welche auch im industriellen Sektor noch nicht an ihrem Entwicklungsendpunkt steht und vielfältige Anwendungspotenziale im Schulkontext, viele offene Forschungsfragen und Entwicklungspotenziale im Rahmen der Bildungsforschung bereithalten.{\textasciicircum}},

	abstract = {Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most important spectroscopy methods in modern chemistry, yet students need help learning and understanding its complex nature. Empirical investigations show that simulation and (interactive) visualizations can support students by offering new possibilities for investigating connections and direct effects of parameter changes. Therefore, this article introduces a digital and interactive learning environment that addresses students’ learning difficulties to facilitate the understanding of crucial 1H NMR background knowledge. The SpinDrops Learning Environment (SDLE) covers practically useful, basic concepts for interpreting a 1H NMR spectrum from a theoretical point of view. It includes new interactive visualizations and a dynamic and realistically simulated ppm-spectrum. To evaluate the role and influence of interactivity by parameter control regarding students’ learning processes and conceptual understanding, we designed two SDLE versions differing in the degree of interactivity and dynamics. We then asked N = 50 students to work with the learning environment in a pre-post study with questionnaires on affective constructs and a 1H NMR knowledge test on conceptual understanding. N = 12 students additionally took part in a think-aloud study. The results showed that students benefit from learning with the SDLE as their conceptual understanding and NMR-related interest, self-efficacy, and estimated knowledge increase significantly. Although the SDLE showed significantly positive effects on students’ learning results and processes, the difference in the degree of interactivity and dynamics inside the software only had a small impact, as revealed in the quantitative and qualitative data.},

The beauty community thus allows to approach to the question of post-digital pedagogy in two respects: On the one hand, it is the object of pedagogical work and interventions, and on the other hand, it is a new social space that enables complex analyses of performances and negotiations of social and gender orders. In this article, the findings of a gender-sociological study of the YouTube beauty community (Richter 2021) are read with regard to the question of the pedagogical implications of post-digital culture. For this purpose, pedagogical problematizations of the beauty community are first presented and then contrasted with selected findings of the focused study in order to develop a productive perspective on these problems: The actors of the community appear situated in contradictions, the production of sovereignty is negotiated as a central value. Post-digital pedagogy, it is argued in conclusion, appears characterised by the analytical potential of studies of digital arenas, which can be used both for studying complex contemporary social transformations and as a basis for pedagogical action – not least in relation to challenges that arise with these new arenas.},

DESIGN: A qualitative descriptive study.
METHODS: Managers (n = 22) and professionals (n = 12) from two public primary, one public special and one private health care organization in Finland participated in semi-structured individual interviews between February and May 2022. Data were analysed using inductive content analysis.
RESULTS: Managers' and professionals' views formed six main categories: providing resources and opportunities for digital competence sharing, creating methods and practices for digital competence sharing, managing digital competence, implementing intergenerational learning, creating a friendly and safe digital organizational atmosphere, and promoting digital competence sharing through leadership.
CONCLUSION: The support of management is significant in promoting the sharing of digital competence in health care organizations. The management of digital competence sharing requires a both resources and a commitment to continuous training and development. It also requires the creation of a collaborative culture to promote mutual learning between professionals and people of different generations.
IMPACT: Due to rapid technological advancements and the resulting load, it is important to focus on the development and sharing of digital competence among health care professionals. The study indicated that managers should have the ability to identify the strengths of professionals' digital competence and be able to utilize them in promoting digital competence sharing. It also highlighted the specific competency requirements for managers in this context. The results can be applied to the training of health care managers and professionals, particularly around digital competence.

              The importance of self-regulation of learning became evident during the Covid-19 pandemic and the accompanying school closures. Using data from
              N
               = 254 German teachers, we analyze how teachers promoted self-regulation of learning in distance education and reasons why they did not promote it. Additionally, we examine which teacher and class variables predict the promotion of self-regulation of learning in distance education and whether teachers’ technology competency moderates these relationships. Further, we look into whether these relationships differ during the first lockdown in spring 2020, for which teachers were not able to prepare for ahead of time, and the beginning of the new school year 2020/2021. Qualitative analyses indicate that teachers focused on promoting metacognitive strategies and used technology to engage students. Reasons why teachers did not promote self-regulation of learning are mostly a lack of resources and misconceptions about students’ competences and needs. Regression analysis show that teachers’ self-efficacy to promote self-regulation of learning and students’ grade predict teachers’ promotion of self-regulation of learning in distance education. Moderation analyses reveal interactions between teachers’ technology competency and class size as well as grade—but only for the period after the summer holidays in 2020/2021. This paper uncovers areas of improvement for teacher education, such as their misconceptions, self-efficacy beliefs, and their technology competency—not only for homeschooling during a pandemic, but also for future learning opportunities in the 21st century that will contain the need for more self-regulation of learning due to the increasing use of technology and digital learning.

            Zusammenfassung
            
              Die Relevanz von Selbstregulation beim Lernen wurde während der Covid-19-Pandemie und den einhergehenden Schulschließungen deutlich. Anhand der Daten von
              N
               = 254 deutschen Lehrkräften untersuchen wir, wie Lehrkräfte Selbstregulation beim Lernen im Distanzunterricht gefördert haben sowie Gründe für die Nichtförderung. Zusätzlich analysieren wir, welche Lehrkräftevariablen und Variablen auf Klassenebene die Förderung von Selbstregulation beim Lernen im Distanzunterricht vorhersagen und ob die Technologiekompetenz der Lehrkräfte diese Zusammenhänge moderiert. Darüber hinaus untersuchen wir, ob sich diese Zusammenhänge während des ersten Lockdowns im Frühjahr 2020, auf den sich die Lehrkräfte nicht vorbereiten konnten, und zu Beginn des neuen Schuljahres 2020/2021 unterscheiden. Wir finden, dass Lehrkräfte einen Fokus auf die Förderung metakognitiver Strategien legten und digitale Medien nutzten, um die Schüler*innen zu erreichen. Gründe für die Nichtförderung lassen sich auf mangelnde Ressourcen zurückführen, gefolgt von Fehlkonzepten über die Kompetenzen und Bedürfnisse ihrer Schüler*innen. Die Ergebnisse multipler Regressionen zeigen, dass die Selbstwirksamkeit der Lehrkräfte und die Klassenstufe die Förderung von Selbstregulation beim Lernen im Distanzunterricht vorhersagen. Moderationsanalysen zeigen signifikante Wechselwirkungen zwischen der Informations- und Kommunikationstechnologiekompetenz der Lehrkräfte und der Klassengröße sowie der Klassenstufe – aber nur für den Zeitraum nach den Sommerferien 2020/2021. Diese Studie deckt mehrere Verbesserungsmöglichkeiten für die Lehrkräfteausbildung auf, wie z. B. die Fehlkonzepte von Lehrkräften, ihre Selbstwirksamkeitsüberzeugungen zur Förderung der Selbstregulation und ihre Kompetenzen im Bereich der Informations- und Kommunikationstechnologie – nicht nur für den Fernunterricht während einer Pandemie, sondern auch für zukünftige Lernmöglichkeiten im 21. Jahrhundert, die aufgrund der zunehmenden Nutzung von Technologie und digitalen Lernumgebungen mehr Selbstregulation beim Lernen erfordern werden.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Today’s success metrics extend beyond traditional literacy and numeracy to encompass strategic learning with a growth mindset, equipping individuals with the attitude and skills to navigate and surmount new challenges. In a digital era, where information is readily available and knowledge constantly evolves, the value placed on learners is not merely based on their current knowledge but on their courage and capability to continually engage cognitive, metacognitive, motivational, social, and emotional resources for lifelong learning. In this dynamic landscape, self-regulated learning (SRL) skills are crucial, empowering students of all ages to take control of their learning journey. SRL, the goal-directed process of monitoring and regulating one’s learning activities, has been shown to significantly influence academic outcomes. Although teachers acknowledge SRL’s relevance, it remains underrepresented in everyday teaching practices, impacting not just student learning but also the training and experiences of preservice teachers in the classroom. This gap perpetuates misconceptions about SRL and hinders its integration into educational settings. Therefore, this special issue first introduces the INSPIRE model of teachers’ multiple roles as instructors, navigators, strategists, promoters, innovators, role models, and encouragers in supporting students to become self-regulated learners and describes teachers’ professional competences to fulfil these roles. Second, it dedicates four articles to exploring teachers’ professional competences in SRL and its promotion in everyday school. The articles address particular aspects of the INSPIRE model and highlight the importance of teachers equipped with the necessary training and competences to guide students in becoming self-regulated learners. Linking the research areas of teachers’ professional competences in SRL and teachers’ promotion of SRL in the classroom this special issue offers a comprehensive approach to SRL in everyday school and opens up perspectives for the transfer into practice.},

              Hintergrund
              Der technologische Wandel im Gesundheitswesen und die digitale Transformation der Lehre erfordern Neuerungen in der studentischen Lehre im Bereich der Medizin. Neue Technologien sind nötig, um die Bereitstellung und Nutzung diverser Lehr- und Lernformate von Bildungseinrichtungen unabhängig von Zeit und Ort zu ermöglichen. Ziel der Studie ist die Analyse der Effektivität verschiedener multidimensionaler Formate in der studentischen Lehre in der chirurgischen HNO-ärztlichen Anatomie.
            
            
              Material und Methoden
              Während des Sommersemesters 2022 und des Wintersemesters 2022/2023 wurde das digitale Lehr- und Lernprogramm ausgeweitet, indem mit Studierenden unterschiedliche Visualisierungsformate (3-D-Brillen, Cardboards oder VR-Brille) im Rahmen eines hochstandardisierten Operationsverfahrens, der Cochleaimplantation, getestet wurden. Prä- und postinterventionell wurde in allen Gruppen eine Wissensstandserhebung und im Anschluss daran eine Evaluation durchgeführt.
            
            
              Ergebnisse
              
                Von 183 Studierenden nahmen 91 Studierende vollständig an der Studie teil. Die postinterventionelle Wissensstandserhebung ergab unabhängig vom Visualisierungsformat einen signifikanten Anstieg der korrekten Antworten. Im direkten Vergleich antwortete die Operationssaal(OP)-Gruppe signifikant häufiger richtig als die Cardboard-Gruppe (
                p
                 = 0,0424). Ein Großteil der Studierenden wünscht sich 3‑D-Lehre als festen Bestandteil im Lehrprogramm (87,9 \%) und ein größeres Streamingangebot von Live-Operationen (93,4 \%). Sie sehen die Anwendung der verschiedenen Technologien als sehr gute Ergänzung zur herkömmlichen chirurgischen Lehre (72,5 \%), da bei guter Anschaulichkeit (89 \%) die Merkfähigkeit (74,7 \%) und Motivation (81,3 \%) steigt.
              
            
            
              Schlussfolgerungen
              Der Einsatz und die Nutzung neuer Visualisierungstechnologien im klinischen Alltag ist ein vielversprechender Ansatz zur Erweiterung der studentischen Ausbildung. Mobile, interaktive und personalisierte technische Formate sind an das Lernverhalten von Studierenden anpassbar. Nicht zuletzt wird durch den Einsatz neuer Medien die Lernmotivation beeinflusst. Eine Erweiterung digitaler Lehr- und Lernformate kann auf der Basis dieser Studie ausdrücklich empfohlen werden.

            Abstract
            
              Background
              Technological change in healthcare and the digital transformation of teaching require innovations in student teaching in medicine. New technologies are needed to enable the delivery and use of diverse teaching and learning formats by educational institutions independent of time and place. The aim of this study is to analyze the effectiveness of different multidimensional formats in student teaching in surgical ENT medical anatomy.
            
            
              Materials and methods
              During the summer semester 2022 and winter semester 2022/2023, the digital teaching and learning program was expanded by testing different visualization formats (3D glasses, cardboards, or VR glasses) with students in the context of a highly standardized surgical procedure, namely cochlear implantation. A pre- and post-intervention knowledge assessment was carried out in all groups, followed by an evaluation.
            
            
              Results
              
                Of 183 students, 91 students fully participated in the study. The post-intervention knowledge assessment showed a significant increase in correct answers regardless of visualization format. In a direct comparison, the operating room (OR) group answered correctly significantly more often than the cardboard group (
                p
                 = 0.0424). The majority of students would like to see 3D teaching as an integral part of the teaching program (87.9\%) and more streaming of live surgeries (93.4\%). They see the use of the various technologies as a very good addition to conventional surgical teaching (72.5\%), as good visualization (89\%) increases retention (74.7\%) and motivation (81.3\%).
              
            
            
              Conclusion
              Application and use of new visualization technologies in everyday clinical practice is a promising approach to expanding student training. Mobile, interactive, and personalized technical formats can be adapted to the learning behavior of students. Last but not least, the use of new media influences learning motivation. An expansion of digital teaching and learning formats can be expressly recommended on the basis of this study.},

	abstract = {The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in education holds potential for improving learning processes. However, ethical aspects surrounding AI implementation have to be considered. This study explores prospective teachers’ attitudes (as a sum of beliefs) towards the ethical principles of AI use in education, namely, transparency, justice and fairness, non-maleficence and well-being, responsibility, privacy, autonomy, and power over people. The sample comprises 90 prospective teachers from vocational education and training. The results indicate that our measurement model for assessing teachers’ attitudes towards the ethical principles of AI use is reliable and valid. Latent profile analysis reveals three distinct profiles of prospective teachers with a different attitude structure. The teachers mainly differ in their belief whether AI should be allowed to exert hard power over teachers and students. We cannot find any association between profile membership and context variables, e. g., gender. The results have implications for the process of integrating AI in education and the development of instructional measures tailored to specific attitude profiles.

            Die Integration künstlicher Intelligenz (KI) in die Bildung hat das Potenzial, Lernprozesse zu verbessern. Bei einer KI-Implementierung sind auch ethische Aspekte zu berücksichtigen. In dieser Studie werden die Einstellungen (als Summe an Überzeugungen) angehender Lehrkräfte zu den ethischen Grundsätzen des Einsatzes von KI im Bildungswesen untersucht. Das sind insbesondere Transparenz, Gerechtigkeit und Fairness, Nichtschädlichkeit und Wohlbefinden, Verantwortung, Privatsphäre, Autonomie und Macht über Menschen. Die Stichprobe umfasst 90 angehende Lehrkräfte aus dem berufsbildenden Bereich. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass das Messmodell zur Bewertung der Einstellung von Lehrkräften zu den ethischen Grundsätzen der KI-Nutzung reliabel und valide ist. Eine latente Profilanalyse offenbart drei Profile von angehenden Lehrkräften mit jeweils unterschiedlichen Einstellungsstrukturen. Die Lehrkräfte unterscheiden sich vor allem hinsichtlich ihrer Einschätzung, ob es KI erlaubt sein sollte, harte Macht über Lehrkräfte und Lernende auszuüben. Es lässt sich kein Zusammenhang zwischen Profilzugehörigkeit und Kontextvariablen, z. B. dem Geschlecht, feststellen. Die Ergebnisse sind von Bedeutung für den Prozess der Integration von KI in den Unterricht und für die Entwicklung von Fortbildungsmaßnahmen, die auf die Einstellungsprofile zugeschnitten werden können.},

	abstract = {The effectiveness of learner–content interaction in online inquiry depends on the extent student cognitive presence can be fostered. This study sought to understand how scaffolding support enhances cognitive presence during the learner–content interaction process in the online environment. Two learning modules on introductory science concepts were developed incorporating the predict observe explain (POE) pedagogical framework. Students engaged with these learning modules to learn the science concepts independently. Data sources comprised post-module interviews, written responses, and observations of student interactions with the online learning modules. Analysis of discussions revealed that the adopted pedagogical framework can effectively foster student cognitive presence during the learner–content interaction process. Findings further revealed that the scaffolding elements embedded into the learning modules contribute to the emergence of higher levels of cognitive presence especially for the students with prior knowledge. Conversely, this study provides evidence that students may develop misconceptions about the science concepts even with the embedded scaffolding and guidance. This study calls for further research into the continual improvement of the pedagogical approach to stimulate cognitive presence for both advanced and novice learners and reduce the potential risk of misconceptions occurring during the learner–content interaction process.},

While educational environments have seen how new digital technologies can enhance learning activities beyond the traditional classroom context, the use of IPDs is still an area insufficiently explored. This paper proposes a set of design goals for the implementation and deployment of engaging interactive public display applications in educational settings. Based on findings from a series of design workshops and two deployment studies in authentic settings, seven design goals were identified and defined. The design goals provide clear guidelines for the design of IPDs for schools by making design teams and stakeholders focus on factors fostering user adoption, social interactions and collaboration. The design goals also opened up paths for further explorations regarding display awareness, level of commitment in interactions, the displays’ integration into structured activities, and display management at the educational institutions.},

A consistent positive relationship between Satisfaction and Academic Performance is found in all the regions. Malaysia presents a unique situation as compared to Mainland China and Hong Kong whereby no association was found between Social Context and Online communication towards Student Engagement. The novelty of this study is attributed to the integration of Social Presence Theory in Student Engagement through the nature of online learning as a coping strategy to halt the spread of COVID-19 during the Omicron variant surge.},

This represents a significant technological advancement that poses opportunities and challenges to educational research and practice. This commentary brings together contributions from nine experts working in the intersection of learning and technology and presents critical reflections on the opportunities, challenges, and implications related to GenAI technologies in the context of education. In the commentary, it is acknowledged that GenAI’s capabilities can enhance some teaching and learning practices, such as learning design, regulation of learning, automated content, feedback, and assessment. Nevertheless, we also highlight its limitations, potential disruptions, ethical consequences, and potential misuses. The identified avenues for further research include the development of new insights into the roles human experts can play, strong and continuous evidence, human-centric design of technology, necessary policy, and support and competence mechanisms. Overall, we concur with the general skeptical optimism about the use of GenAI tools such as LLMs in education. Moreover, we highlight the danger of hastily adopting GenAI tools in education without deep consideration of the efficacy, ecosystem-level implications, ethics, and pedagogical soundness of such practices.},

	abstract = {This study addresses the limited exploration in the literature regarding the influence of EFL teachers’ informal digital learning of English (IDLE) on their creativity in Indonesian EFL classroom instructions. Using a cross-sectional survey design, data were collected from 244 Indonesian EFL teachers, encompassing both pre-service and in-service teachers. Through multiple regression analysis and Rasch modelling analysis, the study evaluated the association between teachers’ IDLE participation, demographics, and their teaching creativity. Findings of the present study revealed that Indonesian EFL pre-service and in-service teachers actively participate in Informal Digital Learning of English (IDLE), which impacts their teaching creativity. Nearly half (49.18\%) engage strongly in activities like listening to English songs and watching YouTube videos, while 36.88\% moderately engage in online educational content and social media conversations. A smaller group (13.93\%) shows lower engagement in IDLE. The regression analysis revealed that while IDLE significantly predicted teaching creativity (p {\textless} 0.001), demographic factors did not indicate a substantial influence on creativity in teaching practices. Additionally, a Rasch-Wright map analysis unveiled that over half of the participants displayed strong creativity in teaching, with a notable inclination among younger teachers towards innovative and student-centered pedagogical strategies. The findings of the current study highlight the need for further exploration into the dynamics between informal digital learning, demographics, and creative teaching approaches, emphasizing the potential for fostering innovative pedagogical practices in language education.},

	abstract = {Multimodal data enables us to capture the cognitive and affective states of students to provide a holistic understanding of learning processes in a wide variety of contexts. With the use of sensing technology, we can capture learners’ states in near real-time and support learning. Moreover, multimodal data allows us to obtain early predictions of learning performance, and support learning in a timely manner. In this contribution, we utilise the notion of ‘carry forward effect’, an inferential and predictive modelling approach that utilises multimodal data measurements detrimental to learning performance to provide timely feedback suggestions. Carry forward effect can provide a way to prioritise conflicting feedback suggestions in a multimodal databased scaffolding tool. We showcase the empirical proof of the carry forward effect with the use of three different learning scenarios: game-based learning, individual debugging, and collaborative debugging.},

Online group assessment (OGA) focuses on assessing peer-group work in an online environment. A total of 64 student teachers participated in this study, where they were divided into multiple groups of four. Each group was required to collaborate on completing an instructional design and engage in OGA activities. We utilized the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) scale to assess the instructional designs of student teachers, evaluating their ability to integrate technology, pedagogy, and content knowledge. In this research, we consider the TPACK scores of each group’s instructional design as their learning performance. The correlations between providing, receiving, and responding to comments and group learning performance were explored by adopting a mixed methods approach. The results indicated that OGA enhanced group learning performance. Providing comments was more associated with improved group learning performance than receiving and responding to them. Furthermore, providing informative comments was more associated with group learning performance than providing other types of comments. In addition, innovative responses were positively associated with group learning performance, while uptake responses were negatively associated with group learning performance. Finally, the discussion and suggestions of intervention for different stages of OGA are provided to help design and implement OGA activities in the future.},

	abstract = {Background  The clinical learning environment (CLE) plays a crucial role in shaping the learning experiences and professional development of medical professionals. Understanding and optimising this environment is essential for improving doctors’ knowledge acquisition, clinical skills, and overall well-being. The development of the Postgraduate Hospital Educational Environment Measure (PHEEM) and its translation to numerous languages has been a milestone in clinical education. Even though PHEEM was recently translated into Arabic, its psychometric properties in this form remain unevaluated. Therefore, this study aims to conduct a comprehensive psychometric analysis of the Arabic version of the PHEEM questionnaire. Methods  This is a cross-sectional questionnaire survey validation study. The defined population were medical residents in Damascus, Syria. A paper-based survey as well as an online-based one were conducted using several nonprobability sampling methods namely, convenience, river and, snowball sampling between June 15, 2023, and June 21, 2023. Both exploratory (EFA) and confirmatory (CFA) factor analyses were conducted. Several psychometric criteria were applied including scree plot, eigenvalue {\textgreater} 1.5 and the ‘proportion of variance accounted for’ criterion. Results  A total of 543 participants completed the questionnaire (56.9\% female). Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure for sample adequacy was high (0.937) and the P-value for Bartlett’s test was {\textless} 0.001. EFA revealed five meaningful factors which were labelled: perception of teachers, learner’s engagement and social participation, external regulation, work culture, and living conditions. These factors had the following eigenvalues: 12.6, 2.18, 2.03, 1.86, and 1.41 respectively, with a total explained variance of 43.45\%. Cronbach’s Alpha was 0.938. CFA confirmed the model structure of EFA (SRMR = 0.067 and RMSEA = 0.066). The Average Variance Explained (AVE) value of any given factor was {\textgreater} 0.7. Discussion  The Arabic PHEEM inventory demonstrated satisfactory psychometric properties. The extracted domains are of theoretical relevance to the psychosocial-material conceptual framework for learning environment. Nonetheless, this validation was performed in the Syrian context; therefore, future studies in other Arabic countries are recommended to support the applicability of Arabic PHEEM in the wide Arab World.},

	abstract = {Over the past two decades, there has been an explosion of innovation in software tools that encapsulate and expand the capabilities of the widely used student peer assessment. While the affordances and pedagogical impacts of traditional in-person, “paper-and-pencil” peer assessment have been studied extensively and are relatively well understood, computerized (online) peer assessment introduced not only shifts in scalability and efficiency, but also entirely new capabilities and forms of social learning interactions, instructor leverage, and distributed cognition, that still need to be researched and systematized. Despite the ample research on traditional peer assessment and evidence of its efficacy, common vocabulary and shared understanding of online peer-assessment system design, including the variety of methods, techniques, and implementations, is still missing. We present key findings of a comprehensive survey based on a systematic research framework for examining and generalizing affordances and constraints of online peer-assessment systems. This framework (a) provides a foundation of a design-science metatheory of online peer assessment, (b) helps structure the discussion of user needs and design options, and (c) informs educators and system design practitioners. We identified two major themes in existing and potential research—orientation towards scaffolded learning vs. exploratory learning and system maturity. We also outlined an agenda for future studies.},

              Universities, significantly impacted by the shift to online learning during pandemic, must critically evaluate their teaching methods and outcomes to enhance performance in the post‐pandemic era. However, there has been a limited examination of whether students achieved comparable levels in cognition and social interaction during the pandemic compared to traditional face‐to‐face learning. Addressing this gap, this exploratory study utilized a quasi‐experimental design to analyse and compare the learning performance and outcomes of two cohorts of students (totalling 45) in a 12‐week university course delivered through the computer‐supported collaborative learning (CSCL) approach, both during and after the pandemic. Employing quantitative analysis and lag sequential analysis, the study examined students' behaviours, similarities and differences in performance within CSCL environments under two distinct social situations. Results indicated that students engaged in complete online learning with CSCL and those in face‐to‐face teaching with CSCL achieved similar levels of conceptual understanding. Additionally, a comparable distribution pattern of learning behaviours was observed. However, significant differences in behaviour sequences emerged between the two implementations, with students exhibiting a higher level of engagement in CSCL activities during the post‐pandemic period. These findings inform the design of CSCL environments should integrate student‐centred activities and include guiding scripts, prompts and scaffoldings in navigating learning endeavours effectively.

                        A well‐designed CSCL environment, coupled with effective instructional strategies, exhibits resilience, sustaining its beneficial effects on students' academic performance and interaction.
                      
                      
                        Both cohorts demonstrated a proclivity for engaging in repetitive behaviours, particularly focused on reviewing and reading activities.
                      
                      
                        The latter cohort displayed a preference for individual tasks over collaborative efforts, showcasing a relatively higher frequency of individual work as opposed to group activities.
                      
                      
                        Notably absent in both groups were crucial behavioural sequences, namely VR‐IA and VC‐IA, underscoring potential areas for CSCL improvement.

                Dementia patients may have language barriers and decreased comprehension ability. Their family caregivers can feel frustrated when communicating with them. Poor communication hinders family caregivers from obtaining accurate health information about patients, and may also increase their emotional burden, affecting patient care quality. The present study developed a virtual reality‐based simulated communication training (VRSCT) system and applied it to a training course for family caregivers of dementia patients. It allowed family caregivers to simulate real‐world situations in a VR environment, experience the daily communication barriers and stress with dementia patients, and apply their acquired knowledge and skills to solve related problems. This study used a randomised control experimental design with mixed analysis methods. A total of 63 family caregivers were recruited and randomly divided into the experimental group (
                N
                 = 32) learning with the VRSCT system to interact with virtual dementia patients and practice communication skills, and the control group (
                N
                 = 31) using the traditional role‐playing method for practice. Quantitative data were analysed to determine participants' knowledge of dementia care, attitudes, communication confidence and skills. In addition, the qualitative method was used to analyse the participants' discussion records. The results showed that by using the VRSCT approach, participants significantly improved their knowledge of dementia care, attitudes, communication confidence and communication skills compared to the control group. In addition, participants reported that through the real‐time feedback of the VRSCT system, they could recognise their previous incorrect communication approach. As a result, they adjusted their communication strategies and increased their self‐confidence.

                        Virtual reality (VR) creates a realistic, highly interactive learning environment, allowing users to be deeply immersed in the learning experience.
                      
                    
                  
                  
                    What this paper adds
                    
                      
                        This study proposed a VR‐based simulated communication training (VRSCT) approach; moreover, seven dementia cases of different degrees of severity were designed in the VR system to enable family members to experience possible challenges of taking care of dementia patients they might encounter in their daily lives.
                      
                      
                        Each case in the VRSCT system has its unique symptoms and communication barriers. The learner in the story plays a caregiver, experiencing and solving the problems and challenges posed by the system.
                      
                      
                        The experimental results show that the proposed method improves learners' knowledge, attitudes, communication confidence, and communication skills related to dementia care.
                      
                    
                  
                  
                    Implications for practice and/or policy
                    
                      
                        Utilising VR training can amplify awareness and secure enhanced social support for dementia‐related challenges.
                      
                      
                        Using VRSCT, as governments and institutions recognise the effectiveness of VR training, they will provide more resources and promote its widespread application.},

However, when teaching interdisciplinary learning to junior undergraduate students, their limited disciplinary knowledge and underrepresentation of students from some disciplines can hinder their learning performance. ChatGPT’s ability to engage in human-like conversations and massive knowledge grounded in different disciplines holds promise in enriching undergraduate students with the disciplinary knowledge that they lack. In this exploratory study, we engaged 130 undergraduate students in a three-condition quasi-experiment to examine how ChatGPT influences their demonstrated and perceived interdisciplinary learning quality, as measured by their online posts and surveys, respectively. The content analysis results show that overall, students’ online posts could be coded into four interdisciplinary learning dimensions: diversity, disciplinary grounding, cognitive advancement, and integration. The means of the first three dimensions were close to the middle level (ranging from 0.708 to 0.897, and the middle level is 1), whereas the mean score of integration was relatively small (i.e., 0.229). Students under the ChatGPT condition demonstrated improved disciplinary grounding. Regarding their perceived interdisciplinary learning quality, we did not find significant differences across the three conditions in the pre- or post-surveys. The findings underscore ChatGPT’s ability to enhance students’ disciplinary grounding and the significance of further fostering their integration skills.},

	abstract = {To support professional competence development in teacher education, learning environments should allow learners to engage with professional tasks. It is crucial for knowledge and skill transfer in such learning environments to real-life context that preservice teachers perceive the task as authentic. However, due to a lack of prior knowledge, novices may have difficulties in recognizing relevant elements of practice. It is thus assumed that different factors may guide their perception of task authenticity independently of the task that has to be mastered. Such factors could be, for example, overt design features of the learning environments on a physical level or the familiarity with the learning context and learning prerequisites, which act as important links for knowledge acquisition. In this study, preservice teachers’ perception of task authenticity is contrasted between two implementation types (video vs. role-play) of the same simulation aiming to foster diagnostic competence. The two types differ in approximating real-life practice concerning the professional task that has to be mastered. In an experimental, longitudinal study, N = 119 mathematics preservice teachers participated online in one type of the simulation four times during one semester (n = 66 video, n = 53 role-play). Perceived task authenticity was higher for the video simulation type and increased with repeated participation in the simulation independently of the implementation type. Further, preservice teachers’ task utility value positively influenced their perception of task authenticity. The results illustrate the role of learning prerequisites as well as familiarity with the task for novices’ perception. Also, they could be an initial indication that, depending on the level of learners’ professional development, the way of approximating real-life practice in simulations might influence the perception of task authenticity.},

This study aimed to explore the current awareness and drivers among dental students and educators regarding environmentally sustainable dentistry (ESD) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and identify barriers and enablers to embrace it.
Methods  A cross-sectional survey using online questionnaires was carried out in six undergraduate dental education institutes within the UAE. Data analysis included descriptive statistics.
Results  In total 153 students and 53 educators participated in the survey. Most students and educators were not aware of any ESD content in their curricula. However, the majority of educators were familiar with the concept of ESD, while students were mostly unfamiliar or slightly familiar. Nonetheless, students largely agreed on its importance and their interest in learning it, as they viewed it relevant to their future practice. Educators agreed that the dental profession has a responsibility to be environmentally friendly and expressed their desire in introducing ESD content into the curricula. Several barriers were reported such as lack of knowledge, curricula space, educational resources, and time. Meanwhile, enablers included providing ESD capacity building, training and resources.
Conclusions  There was no explicit presence of ESD content in the dental curricula in the UAE. Despite the lack of adequate awareness on this topic among educators and more so among students, they both had positive views towards incorporating ESD into dental curricula. Overall, this study highlighted the importance of promoting ESD in dental programs. Clinical significance: ESD is gradually becoming a critical aspect of modern oral healthcare system. It has been mandated in the dental curricula in several regions globally. Embedding ESD in the UAE dental curricula would have several benefits for the environment as well as the future of the dental profession in the region. The clinical significance includes, but not limited to, improved treatment outcomes; patients, students and staff health and well-being; reduced health risks, and cost savings.},

This gap hinders accurate and equitable assessment and instruction, particularly for linguistically diverse students. Advancements in multimodal learning analytics, leveraging sensor technologies, offer innovative solutions for capturing and analysing body movements. This study employs these novel approaches to demonstrate how learners' machine-­ detected body movements during the learning process relate to their verbal and nonverbal contributions to the co-­construction of embodied math knowledge. These findings substantiate the feasibility of utilizing learners' machine-­detected body movements as a valid indicator for inferring their engagement with the collaborative knowledge construction process. In addition, we empirically validate that these inferred different levels of learner engagement indeed impact the desired learning outcomes of the intervention. This study contributes to our scientific understanding of multimodal approaches to knowledge expression and assessment in learning, teaching, and collaboration.},

	abstract = {Deep learning (DL) based methods have been extensively studied for medical image segmentation, mostly emphasizing the design and training of DL networks. Only few attempts were made on developing methods for applying DL models in test time. In this paper, we study whether a given off-the-shelf segmentation network can be stably improved on-the-fly during test time in an online processing-and-learning fashion. We propose a new online test-time method, called TestFit, to improve results of a given off-the-shelf DL segmentation model in test time by actively fitting the test data distribution. TestFit first creates a supplementary network (SuppNet) from the given trained off-the-shelf segmentation network (this original network is referred to as OGNet) and applies SuppNet together with OGNet for test time inference. OGNet keeps its hypothesis derived from the original training set to prevent the model from collapsing, while SuppNet seeks to fit the test data distribution. Segmentation results and supervision signals (for updating SuppNet) are generated by combining the outputs of OGNet and SuppNet on the fly. TestFit needs only one pass on each test sample - the same as the traditional test model pipeline - and requires no training time preparation. Since it is challenging to look at only one test sample and no manual annotation for model update each time, we develop a series of technical treatments for improving the stability and effectiveness of our proposed online test-time training method. TestFit works in a plug-and-play fashion, requires minimal hyper-parameter tuning, and is easy to use in practice. Experiments on a large collection of 2D and 3D datasets demonstrate the capability of our TestFit method.},

	abstract = {Background: The use of actors as standardised patient-instructors (SPI) in clinical interview training in the psychiatry module of the medical curriculum is welcomed by medical students. This study aims to examine the effectiveness of this training in enhancing medical students’ psychiatric interview skills.
Methods: This was a single-blind randomised controlled study with two arms. Between 17 July 2023 and 26 January 2024, year 5 medical students of The Chinese University of Hong Kong who were studying the psychiatry module and had completed the introductory lecture on clinical interview skills were invited to participate. Participants were asked to rate (1) the helpfulness and adequacy of the existing clinical interview training and (2) their confidence in implementing the clinical interview skills. Participants were then randomly assigned to the intervention group or the control group. Participants in the intervention group received a single clinical interview training workshop through a teleconference platform around mid-module, whereas participants in the control group received teaching as usual. Each workshop involved one trained SPI and two students and lasted for 2 hours. Students engaged in two psychiatric scenarios (post-traumatic stress disorder and delusional disorder). The actor interacted with the students and then provided feedback and guidance based on the four key learning points, namely respectful and sincere attitude, attunement, reflective listening, and empathetic understanding. While one student was practising with the actor, the other student observed and provided peer feedback. Outcome measures included the interview skill sub-score and total score of the Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) at the end of the module, as well as perceptions of participants on the workshop.
Results: Of 279 eligible students, 112 were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (n=58, 52\% female) or the control group (n=54, 52\% female). The intervention and control groups were comparable in terms of module-end written examination score, interview skill sub-score of OSCE, and total score of OSCE. Despite this, participants provided highly positive feedback for the clinical interview training using the SPI approach, and 98.3\% considered that the session had a positive effect on clinical communication skills. Nonetheless, the post-workshop confidence levels of participants were not correlated with the interview skill sub-score or the total score of OSCE. Similarly, participants’ perceived positive feedback of the workshop was not correlated with the Interview skill sub-score or the total score of OSCE.
Conclusion: Small-group online clinical interview training using the SPI approach is welcomed by students. Positive subjective outcomes may not match with objective outcomes. Further studies are needed to establish the benefit of the SPI approach.},

In view of the increased use of various technologies for teaching and learning human anatomy, the aim of this study is to explore students' acceptance of four learning technologies using the technology acceptance model (TAM). This work was conducted at a graduate medical school in Singapore with first-year MD Program students. The acceptances of the four learning technologies were compared in two studies. In Study 1 (n = 46), we compared a 3D-printed (3DP) model with Primal Pictures to answer a clinical question in a Spine Anatomy Tutorial; in Study 2 (n = 55), we compared the Anatomage Table and Primal VR for a Brain Anatomy tutorial. There was a statistically significant preference (p {\textless} 0.05) for 3DP models over Primal Pictures for learning Spine Anatomy, and for Primal VR over Anatomage for learning Brain Anatomy. The perceived ease of use of any technology does not appear to influence the behavioral intention to use it. Qualitative feedback suggests that visualization and spatial relationships were among the most important facilitators of learning. Technology should be an enabler in learning but some technologies have a steeper learning curve than others. Therefore, to increase its perceived usefulness, educators must leverage the affordances of the technology when designing learning activities.},

            Searching for information on the web has become an essential task in our society. This article presents a preregistered experimental study that investigates how the knowledge dimension (conceptual, procedural) and relevance of displaying spatiotemporal changes (high, low) for a given search task affect searchers' preference for different resource modalities (websites, videos). Additionally, effects of source reputation (high, low) were examined. Participants were confronted with 16 learning tasks and respective mock‐up video or website search results and had to indicate the likelihood of selecting the respective search results. The learning tasks varied regarding their knowledge dimension and their degree of spatiotemporal changes. Search results varied regarding source reputation and resource modality. Study results showed that search results with low source reputation were more likely to be selected when they were video results as compared to website results. Furthermore, for learning tasks with a high degree of spatiotemporal changes, a preference for videos over website results was found, while a low degree of spatiotemporal changes did not lead to modality preferences. To conclude, both knowledge dimension and degree of visuospatial changes of learning tasks seem to be promising classifications to consider for understanding users' source and modality selection during web‐based learning.},

The interviews were performed remotely and then transcribed into text.
Results: Our findings showed comparable performance expectations between newly graduated and experienced paramedics, mismatches in role clarity of paramedic work, challenges in both learning and upholding professional competence, and difficulties of social acceptance into the paramedic community. There were variations in how expectations were perceived between groups, indicating that experience might partly affect how paramedics identify and manage performance expectations. The organizational socialization framework enables the contextualization of these performance expectations.
Conclusions and Implications: Paramedic work involves challenges to upholding clinical competence, aligning to a professional role, and social integration into the professional community.

This research employs a within-subject two-factor experimental design to investigate the influence of the CL mode on the reading comprehension performance and cooperation level of students with and without VI, considering two text types. The independent variables are CL modes (positive interdependence {\textless}PI{\textgreater} vs. individual accountability {\textless}IA{\textgreater}) and text types (narrative vs. expository). Reading comprehension performance is the outcomeoriented variable, and cooperation level (including knowledge construction, social interaction, and content contribution) is the process-oriented variable. Findings reveal challenges for VI and sighted upper-grade elementary students in reaching higher levels of knowledge construction during cooperative reading tasks. The PI mode demonstrates higher levels of knowledge construction for narrative texts, while the IA mode shows superior content contribution for expository texts. Notably, VI students achieve lower reading comprehension scores than sighted students in the IA mode and face disadvantages in knowledge construction and content contribution across different reading comprehension scenarios. Building upon these findings, this study put forward suggestions to improve reading comprehension and cooperative participation for VI students.},

However, implementing O2O combined with PBL has not been extensively explored in nephrology residency training. This study aims to explore the efficacy of O2O combined with PBL in the standardized residency training of nephrology by comparing it with the traditional lecture-based teaching (LBT).
Methods  Sixty residency trainees who participated in the standardized training of internal medicine in the nephrology department of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine were equally allocated into O2O combined with PBL (O2O/PBL) or the LBT group demographically matched. Examinations of theory, practice skills, clinical thinking and teaching satisfaction surveys were utilized to assess the teaching effects of the two groups.
Results  Participants from the O2O/PBL group outperformed those from the LBT group in the examination of theory (81.233 ± 9.156 vs. 75.800 ± 7.009, mean ± SEM), practice skills (104.433 ± 3.569 vs.100.316 ± 4.628, mean ± SEM) and clinical thinking (88.933 ± 4.473 vs. 86.667 ± 3.844, mean ± SEM). There was no significant difference in the teaching satisfaction between the two groups.
Conclusion  The current study shows the positive impact of O2O combined with PBL approach on standardized residency training in nephrology without reducing teaching satisfaction.},

            Feedback is critical in providing personalized information about educational processes and supporting their performance in online collaborative learning environments. However, giving effective feedback and monitoring its effects, which is especially important in online environments, is a complex issue. Although providing feedback by analyzing online learning behaviors, it is unclear how the effectiveness of this feedback translates into online learning experiences. The current study aims to compare the behavioral patterns of online system engagement of students who receive and do not receive machine learning-based temporal learning analytics (ML-LA) feedback, to identify the differences between student groups in terms of learning performance, online engagement, and various system usage variables, and to examine the behavioral patterns change over time of students regarding online system engagement. The current study was conducted with the participation of 49 undergraduate students. The study defined three engagement levels using system usage analytics and cluster analysis. While t-test and ANCOVA were applied to pre-test and post-test scores to evaluate students’ learning performance and online engagement, lag sequential analysis was used to analyze behavioral patterns, and the Markov chain was used to examine the change of behavioral patterns over time. The group receiving ML-LA feedback showed higher behavior and cognitive engagement than the control group. In addition, the rate of completing learning tasks was higher in the experimental group. Temporal patterns of online engagement behaviors across student groups are described and compared. The results showed that both groups used all stages of the system features. However, there were some differences in the navigation rankings. The most important behavioral transitions in the experimental group are task and discussion viewing and posting, task posting updating, and group performance viewing. In the control group, the most important behavioral transitions are the relationship between viewing a discussion and making a discussion, then this is followed by the sequential relationship between viewing individual performance and viewing group performance. The results showed that students’ engagement behaviors transitioned from light to medium and intense throughout the semester, especially in the experimental group. For learning designers and researchers, this study can help develop a deep understanding of environment design.},

A randomised controlled experiment with 195 students was conducted to investigate the efficacy of the approach. While the treatment group had access to instructions and examples to support their provision of feedback, the control group had no such assistance. Students’ feedback comments were coded using an adaptation of the S.P.A.R.K. (Specific, Prescriptive, Actionable, Referenced, Kind) model. The results indicate that the instructional guide and examples led to students writing more comprehensive comments. The intervention notably enhanced the presence of feedback traits matching the S.P.A.R.K. model and increased instances where multiple traits of quality were observed in a single comment. However, despite the guide’s impact, the students’ ability to provide actionable feedback was limited.

Although CSCL is an increasingly used method in education, there are some problems experienced while using this method. One of them is related to the negative attitudes of students toward CSCL. This negative attitude can reduce the effectiveness of CSCL on the learning process and results. This study investigated the effect of group collaboration processes on students’ attitudes toward CSCL. The research was carried out on students studying at the education faculty of a state university and taking the information technologies II course with the CSCL method. During an academic term, students carried out their course applications as collaborative learning groups that they formed in line with their wishes using the CSCL method. The research was carried out on 209 students. Path analysis was carried out in the research. As a result of the research, it was seen that group atmosphere, transactive memory system, and social interaction space positively affected the positive attitude towards CSCL. In addition, it is seen that the negative attitude towards social interaction space CSCL has the opposite effect. According to the research findings, it can be said that taking measures to improve the group atmosphere, transactive memory system, and social interaction space in CSCL can positively affect the attitude. In line with the findings obtained from the research, various suggestions were made for researchers and educators for the effective use of CSCL environments.},

The study examined the role of online collaboration in facilitating how pre-service TESOL teachers developed their CBLP (TPACK in corpus technology) using a learning-by-design approach, enacted it in co-designing lessons, revised their lessons and reflected on their collective knowledge building processes. Using a case study approach involving 33 participants, the study focused on both intra- and inter-group interactions to understand the pre-service teachers' learning dynamics/changes and unpack the interaction mechanism involved in online collaborative learning. To these ends, we collected data including CBLP group lesson designs, intra-group data (interviews) and inter-group peer critical comments and analysed them based on the two stages (comprehension and transformation) of Shulman's pedagogical reasoning. The results suggest that engaging in online collaboration, facilitated by the learning-by-design approach, is instrumental in enabling pre-service teachers to learn corpus technology and expand their repertoire of teaching strategies. Our findings imply that both intra- and inter-group collaboration modes are important to help pre-service TESOL teachers holistically develop TPACK for language teaching. Similar implications may be applied to other subject-specific TPACK training.Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Teacher preparation programmes play a crucial role in developing pre-service teachers' technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge (TPACK) TPACK integration into pedagogical practice and subject-specific professional development opportunities are important for effective teaching, but there is a lack of research on subject-specific TPACK development (eg, TPACK in language teaching) Online collaborative learning can support TPACK development, but most studies focused on intra-group interactions with little attention to inter-group interactions What this paper adds Introduces a new corpus-based language pedagogy (CBLP) for TESOL teachers to help them develop TPACK in language teaching Presents an innovative two-step training framework for developing TESOL teachers' TPACK in corpus technology Examines the role of online collaboration in developing pre-service TESOL teachers' TPACK for teaching with corpus technology through learning by design Provides in-depth qualitative data analysed both qualitatively and quantitatively to investigate the specific roles that intra-group and inter-group interactions play in shaping pre-service TESOL teachers' CBLP development Develops an analytical framework comprising nine categories (under the comprehension and transformation stages of Shulman's pedagogical reasoning model) to code pre-service TESOL teachers' TPACK development in corpus technology Finds that intra-group interactions facilitate both comprehension and transformation stages, while inter-group interactions predominantly facilitate the transformation stage of CBLP Implications for practice Emphasises hands-on corpus-searching skills and guidance on browsing corpora when designing CBLP lessons Encourages both within-group and between-group interactions in online collaborative learning to foster TPACK development for using corpus technology in teaching language subjects Considers incorporating similar approaches for developing other subject-specific TPACK for other teaching subjects},

Besides, this study proposes to evaluate the planned online nursing education based on Anderson’s theory. With a phenomenological qualitative design, the study sample included 17 nursing students using purposive sampling. In-depth semi-structured interviews were performed to collect data. The data were analysed using the interpretative phenomenological analysis method. Three major themes were identified as follows: (a)Practice skills learning experiences; (b)Coping process in practice skills learning; (c)Suggestions to improve online practice skills learning process. Students expressed both positive and negative experiences. To cope with the process, they used different learning materials as well as individual ways of coping. They also offered suggestions on the learning process, teaching content and interaction and evaluation for practice skill learning in online education. The findings demonstrated that students perceived inadequacy in these skills but also expressed that they improved their psychomotor, cognitive and affective skills. In addition, Anderson’s theory created positive results in the online nursing skill training process.},

However, research informs us that online learners are usually less likely to complete the learning experience and more likely to drop out compared to learners studying in traditional face-to-face learning environments. One major factor for low completion rates emerges as learners’ satisfaction with the learning experience. The purposes of the study were to investigate the structural relationships among the factors that affect online learners’ satisfaction and to develop a structural model that explains satisfaction in online learning environments. We used social cognitive theory and the Macro Model of Motivation and Performance as theoretical frameworks and investigated the structural relationships among metacognitive self-regulation, self-efficacy for interacting with the instructor and peers, task value, learning design, perceived learning, and satisfaction with the learning experience. Participants consisted of 1297 higher education students who were enrolled in fully online courses. We adopted the structural equation modeling approach to investigate the relationships among the factors in the research model. Results revealed that selfregulation, self-efficacy, task value, and learning design had significant effects on perceived learning and satisfaction and perceived learning significantly influenced satisfaction. Moreover, learning design had a large effect on perceived learning and perceived learning mediated the relationships between satisfaction and self-efficacy, task value, and learning design. The findings have implications for designing online learning environments that incorporate learning design standards and generate greater levels of learning outcomes.},

The main research objectives are to design and pilot a model to determine students’ learning styles to create personalized online courses. The study also addressed an effective method to identify learning styles and evaluate how student’s learning styles impact students’ learning outcomes. With an aim to personalize suitable content and learning process for each student, machine learning techniques have been used to detect students’ learning styles and classified them into learning styles based on the VARK model by analyzing learning activity data. Based on students’ learning styles, rules were proposed to select appropriate content and learning processes. The research results show that the SVM method performs the best among classification methods used to determine students’ learning styles. In addition, a plugin was developed on the Moodle system to support the automatic identification of students’ learning styles, based on which a learning process and appropriate content were generated to test the model’s results. The experiment results also indicate that students with a visual learning style had better learning outcomes in theory-oriented courses. In contrast, students with a kinesthetic learning style had better learning outcomes in practice-oriented courses. Although the experiment was only conducted on a small scale, the positive results show that the model can fully meet the needs of large-scale LMS systems.},

It shapes team behaviour, fostering shared perceptions, group synchrony and a common goal-oriented approach. This affinity becomes evident in dynamic interactions, offering insights into team behaviour through interaction data analysis. Interpreting interaction data proves complex, hampering our understanding and insights into shared team perceptions and task cohesion development. This paper used temporal motif analysis to examine the changes in team members’ cohesive perceptions and behaviours, including task cohesion, performance outcomes, engagement and group synchrony. Trace data from an online workintegrated learning environment captured learning behaviours, while responses to a questionnaire at different stages of a study program captured task cohesion and cohesive perceptions. The findings reveal teams with strong task cohesion and high performance tend to share similar cohesive perceptions driven by interdependent interactions. Conversely, teams with different cohesion perceptions have lower interaction interdependence and poorer performance. Through analysing team interaction data, this study uncovered key insights to promote positive adjustments aligning team perceptions, enhancing collaborative learning and offering support for improved performance, engagement and synchrony among teams, ultimately benefiting learning outcomes and the cultivation of skills and competencies.},

	abstract = {Purpose  Many health professions education programs involve people with lived experience as expert speakers. Such presentations may help learners better understand the realities of living with chronic illness or experiencing an acute health problem. However, lectures from only one or a small number of people may not adequately illustrate the perspectives and experiences of a diverse patient cohort. Additionally, logistical constraints such as public health restrictions or travel barriers may impede in-person presentations, particularly among people who have more restrictions on their time. Health professions education programs may benefit from understanding the potential effects of online patient-led presentations with a diverse set of speakers. We aimed to explore whether patient-led online learning modules about diabetes care would influence learners’ responses to clinical scenarios and to collect learners’ feedback about the modules. Method  This within-subjects randomized experiment involved 26 third-year medical students at Université Laval in Quebec, Canada. Participation in the experiment was an optional component within a required course. Prior to the intervention, participating learners responded to three clinical scenarios randomly selected from a set of six such scenarios. Each participant responded to the other three scenarios after the intervention. The intervention consisted of patient-led online learning modules incorporating segments of narratives from 21 patient partners (11 racialized or Indigenous) describing why and how clinicians could provide patient-centered care. Working with clinical teachers and psychometric experts, we developed a scoring grid based on the biopsychosocial model and set 0.6 as a passing score. Independent evaluators, blinded to whether each response was collected before or after the intervention, then scored learners’ responses to scenarios using the grid. We used Fisher’s Exact test to compare proportions of passing scores before and after the intervention.},

Peer tutoring gives students of all skill levels the chance to collaborate, democratically, and amicably work on academic assignments in pairs. With this method, students with different levels of intelligence rely on one another to understand academic material, especially while completing challenging assignments. Hence, the current investigation aims to explore the effectiveness of online peer tutoring programs in college education. The findings of the analysis indicate that the impact of online peer tutoring on academic performance is consistent across diverse academic disciplines. By examining the full range of advantages of online tutoring programs in higher education, examining their effects on students’ learning engagement, concentrating on China as a special context, and providing helpful recommendations for their implementation in higher education, the study makes a novel contribution to the field of online tutoring programs. The results demonstrate that college students who regularly engage in online peer tutoring are more likely to have higher retention rates. As per the findings, the analysis proves that online peer tutoring significantly enhances the sense of community among college students, leading to increased engagement in their coursework.

Social presence –the sense of being with others–is key to mitigating this distance. However, our understanding of social presence remains limited, despite its potential to reduce social isolation and cultivate a conducive social space in online education. A gap in our understanding relates to how social presence aligns with more general accounts of interpersonal representations under conditions of psychological distance, as presented in Construal Level Theory. We conducted a vignette-based experiment (N = 194) to examine how psychological distance in online learning affects the mental construal level of a hypothetical partner and, thus, social presence perceptions. Findings suggest that increased psychological distance leads to higher-level construals, resulting in a perception of conversation partners as non-descript and homogenous. Importantly, this affects social presence perceptions, with certain nuances. These findings can inform novel approaches to enhance social presence in online learning.},

Objectives: This paper reports on the findings of an explorative study that aimed to increase our understanding of the nature and role of peer feedback in the students' learning process in a computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) setting. Exploring what types of feedback are used, and how they relate to each other and are related to academic performance has important implications for students and teachers.
Methods: This study was conducted in the higher education setting. It used a dataset consisting of student peer feedback messages (N = 2444) and grades from 231 students who participated in a large engineering course. Using qualitative methods, peer feedback was coded inductively. Epistemic network analysis (ENA) was used to analyse the relation between peer feedback types and performance.
Results: Based on the five types of peer feedback (i.e., ‘management’, ‘cognition’ ‘affect’, ‘interpersonal factors’ and ‘suggestions for improvements’), the results of the ENA showed that student feedback categories ‘management’, ‘cognition’ and ‘affect’ were positively related to student performance at the formative assessment phase.
Conclusions: The findings and the ENA visualizations also show that ‘suggestions for improvement’ and ‘interpersonal factors’ were not a significant part of student learning in peer assessment and feedback in the studied context.},

Sixty-seven Hong Kong secondary school students created their own generative-AI tools using open-source language models and wrote short stories with them. The study collected and analyzed the students’ generative-AI tools, short stories, and written reflections on their conditions or purposes for prompting. The research identified three main themes regarding the purposes for which students’ prompt generative-AI tools during short story writing: a lack of awareness of purposes, overcoming writer’s block, and developing, expanding, and improving the story. The study also identified common characteristics of students’ activity systems, including the sophistication of their generative-AI tools, the quality of their stories, and their school’s overall academic achievement level, for their prompting of generative-AI tools for the three purposes during short story writing. The study’s findings suggest that teachers should be aware of students’ purposes for prompting generative-AI tools to provide tailored instructions and scaffolded guidance. The findings may also help designers provide differentiated instructions for users at various levels of story development when using a generative-AI tool.},

	abstract = {This study investigated the added value of real-time adaptive feedback on seventh graders' performances in tablet-based geometry learning. To isolate the effects of the medium (ie, tablet) from those of the feedback, three groups were compared: paper-and-pencil, pen-based tablet without feedback and pen-based tablet with feedback. The feedback was provided by a tutoring system based on an artificial intelligence that automatically interpreted students' pen strokes on the screen. A total of 85 French students drew three geometric shapes, either on paper or on a tablet, and then performed a transfer task on paper. Results showed that using a tablet without feedback did not improve learning but seemed to enhance interest in the task compared to the paper-and-pencil group. Students in the tablet with feedback group performed significantly better than the other two groups on learning, as well as on transfer. This study was the first to combine media comparison and added-value approaches to test the effects on students' geometry performances of using a new educational app on a pen-based tablet in a naturalistic classroom environment. Results showed that it was not the medium used but the intelligent tutoring system-based feedback that improved students' performance. Our data therefore indicate that artificial intelligence is a promising way of providing learners with real-time adaptive feedback in order to improve their performances. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Previous meta-analyses have investigated the effects of tablet-based learning. Tablet computers have been proven to increase students' motivation. Yet, the influence of tablet computers on learning outcomes remains inconclusive. Other studies show that certain features of environments, such as feedback, have positive effects on learning. What this paper adds Most of the previous studies adopted a media comparison approach (paper- vs. tablet-based instruction). We combine this approach with an added-value approach by adding or not real-time AI-based feedback. Results showed that tablet use increased children's interest but not their learning outcomes. Feedback improved children's performance in a training task and a later transfer paper task. Implications for practice and/or policy Tablet computers can promote students' interest in the task during geometry instruction. App features play a critical role in improving students' learning. Specifically, IA-based adaptive feedback helps children to perform better on a geometry task.},

Participants were students in a hybrid graduate-level course with weekly synchronous computer-mediated discussions. Adapting Du Bois’ stancetaking triangle, we coded discussion transcripts for shifts in stance and for evidence of influence on students’ perspective taking as they considered course concepts. Findings were that stances and stance objects (that is, topics) were introduced as students collaborated in discussion, with an epistemic stance indicating students’ primary focus on wanting to learn and understand course concepts. Evaluative and affective stances were less frequent and most often intertwined with an epistemic stance but nevertheless important in supporting the group’s discussion. Synchronous online discussions afforded a venue for iterative discourse interactions of evaluation, positioning, and alignment and for shared knowledge co-construction and perspectival understanding.},

However, the success of this approach is governed by different factors, which have been accentuated in recent years. The implementation of peer assessment is consequently a challenging task in the current context. This work investigates peer assessment strategies in seven Computer Engineering courses. Students’ performance and assessment accuracy are analyzed throughout five academic years, covering the transition from offline to online methodologies according to the evolution of educational environments. More specifically, peer and lecturer’s grades are examined to identify correlations or deviations in two execution phases. The first phase involves the analysis of in-class offline peer assessments during four academic years, integrated as part of continuous assessment tasks. The second phase deals with the evaluation of online peer assessments in 2021/2022, considering different platforms to manage submissions and reviews. The offline experience denotes statistical correlations between the grades assigned by the peers and the lecturer, while also revealing patterns that affected the performance of students. In addition, the switch to online methodologies does not significantly affect the assessments in courses that adopted peer strategies in the past. Finally, comparable results are obtained under single-blind and double-blind models after careful training.},

	abstract = {Background  Major disruptions and changes in education have occurred worldwide as a result of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and the ensuing shift from in-person to online education. However, the effect of such changes on medical education, its magnitude, and the learning domains impacted by such rapid changes have not been adequately addressed, particularly with regard to objective assessment approaches.
Methods  Second-year medical students enrolled in our Medical English Course between 2019 and 2021 were recruited from Hokkaido University, Japan (N = 321) to participate in this study. We evaluated the potential impact of teaching styles on the academic performance of students before (2019; face-to-face) and during (2020; online; 2021; in-person and online) the pandemic. We examined the potential effect of three teaching styles––in-person (2019), online (2020), and a combination of these (2021) on the academic performance of medical students using: (i) subjective assessment of self-reported general English skills, including reading, writing, listening, and speaking; and (ii) objective assessment of medical terminology scores, evidence-based medicine (EBM) skills, and final written exam scores.
Results  In-person education significantly improved listening and speaking skills in 2019 (p {\textless} 0.001). This trend was observed for writing skills in an online course in 2020 (p = 0.001). With the combined teaching method, students reported significant improvements in all four English skills. In our objective assessments, medical terminology improved significantly post-test versus pre-test for all three teaching styles, and we found that the online course did not adversely affect the gain in medical terminology knowledge during the course. Additionally, we did not find any significant differences across the three applied teaching styles regarding EBM skill levels. It is noteworthy that the students taking online courses had a significantly higher final exam score (mean ± SD; 82.8 ± 8.2) than in in-person (78.6 ± 8.8) and combined (79.7 ± 12.1) teaching styles.
Conclusions  In our study, the online/combined courses showed better academic outcomes compared to the faceto-face course in the preclinical clerkship. Although the current results need to be replicated on a larger scale, online/ combined courses can continue and evolve in the post-pandemic education of medical students. Medical schools and institutions should consider incorporating such courses, especially combined courses, into their curricula in the future to improve the effectiveness, accessibility, and flexibility of medical education.},

	abstract = {Children with neurodevelopmental disorders often have social–emotional difficulties. Serious games can be used to support their social–emotional learning. This study investigated if 6–10-year-old children with autism spectrum condition, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and developmental language disorder would improve their emotion discrimination skills by playing a serious game. Intervention (n = 30) and control groups (n = 20), comprising children with neurodevelopmental disorders, and a group of typically developing (TD) age peers (n = 106), completed six emotion discrimination tasks. ABA research design was applied in this study. Prior to the game intervention, children with neurodevelopmental disorders were significantly delayed in relation to their TD age peers in all tasks. After playing the game for two months, the children in the intervention group had significantly improved their emotion discrimination skills in four tasks, whereas the control group had significantly advanced in only one task without practice. Intervention gains were maintained at the one-month follow-up. Parents reported that the children in the intervention group somewhat improved their emotion recognition and behavioural skills in daily life in comparison to the control group. Implications for practice are discussed. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Children with neurodevelopmental disorders often exhibit various social–emotional symptoms. Within the field of social–emotional learning, many serious games have a narrow focus on specific skills, and they often only provide possibilities for observing target behaviours, not actual skill training. There are mixed results on the efficacy of game-based interventions targeted at improving social–emotional skills. What this paper adds The Emotion Detectives game used in this study offers a well-designed learning environment that provides adaptive learning and feedback systems. The participating children's social–emotional skills were assessed with versatile methods and via triangulation. Intervention with the Emotion Detectives game helped to decrease some emotion and behavioural symptoms of the players. Implications for practice This study provides information about the efficacy of a web-based game that is freely available for supporting children's social–emotional learning. Improvements in emotion discrimination and recognition, as well as behavioural skills, can be gained by playing serious games. For optimal intervention outcomes, multimodal training should be utilized in serious games targeting social–emotional learning.},

	abstract = {Formative assessment is essential for improving teaching and learning, and AI and visualization techniques provide great potential for its design and delivery. Using NLP, cognitive diagnostic and visualization techniques designed to analyse and present students' monthly exam data, we developed an AI-enabled visual report tool comprising six modules and conducted an empirical study of its effectiveness in a high school biology classroom. A total of 125 students in a ninth-grade biology course were assigned to a treatment group (n = 63) receiving AI-enabled visual reports as the intervention and a control group (n = 62) receiving overall oral feedback from the teacher. We present the main statistical results of the within-subjects design and the between-subjects design respectively, to better capture the main findings. Repeated measures ANOVA revealed a significant interaction effect of intervention and time on learning achievement, and the paired-sample Wilcoxon test indicated that the treatment group had experienced increasing learning anxiety (Cohen's d = 0.203, p = 0.046) and self-efficacy (Cohen's d = 1.793, p = 0.000) over time. Moreover, we conducted a series of non-parametric tests to compare the effects of AI-enabled visual reports and teacher feedback, but found no significant differences except for an increased self-efficacy (Cohen's d = 0.312, p = 0.046). Additionally, we had the students in the treatment group rate their favourable modules in the AI-enabled visual report and provide evaluative feedback. The study results provide important insights into the design and implementation of effective formative assessment supported by artificial AI and visualization techniques. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Formative assessment is essential for improving teaching and learning. Traditional formative assessment tools lack accurate data-oriented assessment and usability. AI and visualization techniques have great potential for formative assessment. What this paper adds This study designs and implements an AI-enabled visual report tool that generates data-driven, user-friendly reports. The AI-enabled visual report can not only enhance students' learning achievement and self-regulated learning over time but also increase their test anxiety. The AI-enabled visual report has a comparable effect with teacher feedback but leads to increased self-efficacy. Implications for practice and/or policy We recommend using the AI-enabled visual report in large-size classes for its overall positive effects on both learning achievement and self-regulated learning. We recommend using the AI-enabled visual report over teacher feedback for its capacity to enhance students' self-efficacy. We recommend prioritizing the modules of Performance Ranking, Personal Mastery and Knowledge Alert when designing the AI-enabled visual report.},

	abstract = {People in modern society are media multitaskers due to portable devices and omnipresent wireless networks, and college students are no exception. Previous studies have indicated that students' media multitasking behaviours in class harm their academic performances, and understanding the reasons for college students' engagement in such behaviour is meaningful. However, the literature takes media multitasking behaviour as an audience behaviour, which ignores the interaction between students and their surroundings. This study fills this gap by emphasizing the role of the social learning process. A survey was conducted in a public and comprehensive university in western China, and a total of 457 valid respondents were obtained. The results from PLS-SEM revealed that college students' in-class media multitasking behaviours were influenced by both observational learning (ie, imitating others) and reinforcement learning (ie, in-class interventions), and this learning process was shaped by students' media multitasking self-efficacy and self-management of learning. These findings contribute to the current literature by providing a relatively new perspective for understanding college students' in-class media multitasking behaviours, and suggestions about how to deal with such behaviours are also provided. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic In-class media multitasking behaviours (ICMMBs) damage college students' academic performance. College students' ICMMBs are affected by individual factors, such as internet addiction and sensation seeking. Social learning theory is widely adopted as a general theoretical background to explain those behaviours of which possible consequences are easily observed no matter from others or from individuals themselves. What this paper adds This work enriches the media multitasking literature by investigating the predictors of ICMMBs from a relatively new perspective, that is, the social learning perspective. This work also contributes to the literature on media multitasking by examining how the social learning process of college students' ICMMBs differs across students. This work extends the application scope of social learning theory to the context of college students' ICMMBs. Implications for practice and/or policy. The role of imitating others proves the importance of the learning atmosphere in classrooms, so teachers or lecturers should pay special attention to build a learning atmosphere away from ICMMBs. Some in-class interventions should be established, especially the formal policy of schools to require students to hand in their smartphones or other media before class and students' own mindfulness of such behaviour. Teachers or lecturers should take actions to lower the academic performance expectations of students with higher media multitasking self-efficacy (MMSE) because students with higher MMSE often overestimate their capabilities to have good performance when conducting other tasks simultaneously.},

	abstract = {There is a global trend in the increased adoption of e-assessment in school classrooms to enhance learning. Teachers, as classroom-based assessment designers and implementers, play a vital role in such assessment change. However, little is known about school teachers' classroom-based e-assessment practices and the underlying reasons. To address this research gap, this study identified the factors influencing Hong Kong primary school teachers' e-assessment practices underpinned by the theory of planned behaviour (TPB). A large-scale survey was issued to 878 teachers via Qualtrics. Structural equation modelling (SEM) analysis shows that primary school teachers' intentions of using e-assessment and perceived behavioural control of it were the two strongest factors predicting their e-assessment practices in a general way. Specifically, teachers' intentions outweighed perceived behavioural control in determining their use of alternative e-assessment tasks and e-feedback, but this reversed for e-tests/exercises. The impact of perceived behavioural control was consistent across the three types of e-assessment practices. Furthermore, teachers' attitudes significantly influenced their intentions to use alternative e-assessment tasks, while subject norms primarily predicted their intentions to use e-feedback. The findings have implications for primary schools to take countermeasures to facilitate the successful implementation of e-assessment at the classroom level.Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic E-assessment has the potential to influence learning. E-assessment has often been used in a controlled environment with a relatively small sample size. The past 3 years have seen a surge in discussions and research around using e-assessment in classroom settings, mostly in higher education. What this paper adds Primary school teachers used more e-tests or exercises than alternative e-assessment tasks and e-feedback in their daily teaching. Teachers' intentions outweighed perceived behavioural control in determining their use of alternative e-assessment tasks and e-feedback, but this reversed for e-tests/exercises. Teachers' attitudes significantly influenced their intentions to use alternative e-assessment tasks, while subject norms primarily predicted their intentions to use e-feedback. Implications for practice and/or policy Teachers' intentions of using alternative e-assessment and e-feedback should be increased to enhance their usage in the classroom. Teachers' e-assessment literacy should be developed to enable them to integrate e-assessment into their daily instruction.},

	abstract = {Single-case experimental designs (SCEDs) may offer a reliable and internally valid way to evaluate technology-enhanced learning (℡). A systematic review was conducted to provide an overview of what, why and how SCEDs are used to evaluate ℡. Accordingly, 136 studies from nine databases fulfilling the inclusion criteria were included. The results showed that most of the studies were conducted in the field of special education focusing on evaluating the effectiveness of computer-assisted instructions, video prompts and mobile devices to improve language and communication, socio-emotional, skills and mental health. The research objective of most studies was to evaluate the effects of the intervention; often no specific justification for using SCED was provided. Additionally, multiple baseline and phase designs were the most common SCED types, with most measurements in the intervention phase. Frequent data collection methods were observation, tests, questionnaires and task analysis, whereas, visual and descriptive analysis were common methods for data analysis. Nearly half of the studies did not acknowledge any limitations, while a few mentioned generalization and small sample size as limitations. The review provides valuable insights into utilizing SCEDs to advance ℡ evaluation methodology and concludes with a reflection on further opportunities that SCEDs can offer for evaluating ℡.Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic SCEDs use multiple measurements to study a single participant over multiple conditions, in the absence and presence of an intervention SCEDs can be rigorous designs for evaluating behaviour change caused by any intervention, including for testing technology-based interventions.

	abstract = {This study addresses the need for inclusive AI education by focusing on marginalized female students who historically lack access to learning opportunities in computing. It applies the theoretical framework of intersectionality to understand how gender, race and ethnicity intersect to shape these students' learning experiences and outcomes. Specifically, this study investigated 27 high-school students' cognitive engagement in machine learning practices. We conducted the Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test to explore differences in cognitive engagement between marginalized female students and their peers, employed comparative content analysis to delve into significant differences and analysed interview data thematically to gain deeper insights into students' machine learning model development processes. The findings indicated that, when engaging in machine learning practices requiring drawing diverse cultural perspectives, marginalized female students demonstrated significantly higher performance compared to their peers. In particular, marginalized female students exhibited strengths in holistic language analysis, paying attention to writers' intentions and recognizing cultural nuances in language. This study suggests that integrating language analysis and machine learning across subjects has the potential to empower marginalized female students and amplify their perspectives. Furthermore, it calls for a strengths-based approach to reshape the narrative of underrepresentation and promote equitable participation in machine learning and AI. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Female students, particularly those from underrepresented groups such as African American and Latina students, often experience low levels of cognitive engagement in computing. Marginalized female students possess unique strengths that, when nurtured, have the potential to not only transform their own learning experiences but also contribute to the advancement of the computing field. It is critical to empower marginalized female students in K-12 AI (ie, a subfield of computing) education, seeking to bridge the gender and racial disparity in AI. What this paper adds Marginalized female students outperformed their peers in responding to machine learning questions related to feature analysis and feature distribution interpretation. When responding to these questions, they demonstrated a holistic approach to analysing language by considering interactions between features and writers' intentions. They drew on knowledge about how language was used to convey meaning in different cultural contexts. Implications for practice and/or policy Educators should design learning environments that encourage students to draw upon their cultural backgrounds, linguistic insights and diverse experiences to enhance their engagement and performance in AI-related activities. Educators should strategically integrate language analysis and machine learning across different subjects to create interdisciplinary learning experiences that support students' exploration of the interplay among language, culture and AI. Educational institutions and policy initiatives should adopt a strengths-based approach that focuses on empowering marginalized female students by acknowledging their inherent abilities and diverse backgrounds.},

	abstract = {Gamification, characterized by the integration of game design elements into non-game environments, has gained popularity in classrooms due to its potential for increased engagement and enjoyment compared to traditional lecture-based teaching methods. While students generally exhibit positive attitudes towards gamification, its impact on academic achievement remains a subject of debate. This study employed a meta-analysis approach to examine the overall influence of gamification on students' academic performance. The sample comprised 22 experimental studies conducted between 2008 and 2023, comparing the effects of gamified and non-gamified classes. Utilizing a random effects model, the results revealed a moderately positive effect of gamification on student academic performance (Hedges's g = 0.782, p {\textless} 0.05). The paper further discussed the outcomes of various moderator analyses, providing valuable insights into the selection and utilization of game design elements, as well as considerations specific to different educational stages.Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Most research has consistently demonstrated that gamification has a positive impact on students' achievement. The current state of review research is not sufficiently comprehensive. There is a lack of meta-analyses exploring the diverse impacts of gamification. What this paper adds The effect of factors such as geographical regions, education levels, learning environments, subjects and game elements on gamification was examined. The study revealed a significant and positive impact of gamification on students' achievement across various factors, including geographical regions, education levels, learning environments, subjects and game elements. Implications for practice and/or policy Gamification represents a prudent choice for teachers seeking to enhance students' achievement. Teachers are suggested to adopt and employ appropriate game elements in their instructional approaches. Future research could focus on investigating the impact of feedback as a game element in teaching and learning.},

	abstract = {In the ever-evolving AI-driven education, integrating AI technologies into teaching practices has become increasingly imperative for aspiring STEM educators. Yet, there remains a dearth of studies exploring pre-service STEM teachers' readiness to incorporate AI into their teaching practices. This study examined the factors influencing teachers' willingness to integrate AI (WIAI), especially from the perspective of pre-service STEM teachers' attitudes towards the application of AI in teaching. In the study, a comprehensive survey was conducted among 239 pre-service STEM teachers, examining the influences and interconnectedness of Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK), Perceived Usefulness (PU), Perceived Ease of Use (PE), and Self-Efficacy (SE) on WIAI. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was employed for data analysis. The findings illuminated direct influences of TPACK, PU, PE, and SE on WIAI. TPACK was found to directly affect PE, PU, and SE, while PE and PU also directly influenced SE. Further analysis revealed significant mediating roles of PE, PU, and SE in the relationship between TPACK and WIAI, highlighting the presence of a chain mediation effect. In light of these insights, the study offers several recommendations on promoting pre-service STEM teachers' willingness to integrate AI into their teaching practices. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic? The potential of AI technologies to enrich learning experiences and improve outcomes in STEM education has been recognized. Pre-service teachers' willingness to integrate AI into teaching practice is crucial for shaping the future learning environment. The TAM and TPACK frameworks are used to analyse teacher factors in technology-supported learning environments. Few studies have been conducted for examining factors of pre-service teachers' willingness to integrate AI into teaching practices in the context of STEM education. What this paper adds? A survey was designed and developed for exploring pre-service STEM teachers' WIAI and its relationships with factors including TPACK, PE, PU, and SE. TPACK, SE, PU, and PE have direct impact on pre-service STEM teachers' WIAI. SE, PU, and PE have been identified as mediating variables in the relationship between TPACK and WIAI. Two sequential mediation effects, TPACK → PE → SE → WIAI and TPACK → PU → SE → WIAI, among pre-service STEM teachers were further identified. Implications of this study for practice and/or policy Pre-service STEM teachers are encouraged to explore and utilize AI technology to enhance their confidence and self-efficacy in integrating AI into teaching practices. Showcasing successful cases and practical experiences is essential for fostering awareness of AI integration in STEM education. It is recommended to introduce AI education courses in teacher training programs. Offering internship and practicum opportunities related to AI technologies can enhance their practical skills in integrating AI into education.},

	abstract = {This study investigates a virtual reality (VR) cross-cultural interactive learning environment that combines a 360-degree video camera for content creation, a viewing tool, and a video conference platform for real-time interaction. This environment aims to address the limitations of traditional 360-degree VR tools, particularly in enabling simultaneous, interactive engagement among multiple users. The study recruited 31 university students from China and Indonesia utilizing convenience sampling to test the efficacy of the environment in fostering cognitive development and challenging cross-cultural stereotypes. The methodology included analysing student-created content, questionnaire responses, and insights from semistructured interviews. The analysis, grounded in a cognitive development taxonomy and an assessment of stereotype changes, revealed that the students reached the “remember” and “understand” cognitive levels. Additionally, prevalent stereotypes held by the students were addressed. The immersive nature of the VR environment and the interactions with foreign peers were highly appreciated, significantly contributing to cognitive growth and stereotype mitigation. These findings offer valuable insights for educators and researchers in technology-assisted cross-cultural education, emphasizing the importance of designing interactive VR-based activities that effectively facilitate cognitive development and address cross-cultural stereotypes.Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Telecollaborative projects have been widely implemented to facilitate intercultural learning. Scholars have employed 360-degree video technology to develop virtual reality (VR) learning environments. 360-degree videos offer a panoramic view of different cultures, enabling learners to explore and interact with their surroundings, thus fostering contextualized learning experiences. Such videos can enhance student engagement, motivation, and learning effectiveness. What this paper contributes The existing 360-degree video technology offers only a restricted range of learning scenarios, especially in terms of the capability to enable multiple students to watch virtual reality (VR) content using head-mounted displays (HMDs) and engage in real-time interactions simultaneously. To overcome this limitation, we developed a virtual reality (VR) cross-cultural interactive learning environment. Our solution includes a 360-degree video viewing tool with which students can watch the created content, along with an online video conference platform that facilitates the observation of each other's viewed content through their HMDs, and enables real-time communication among students to discuss the content they are experiencing. Implications for practice or policy The integration of our VR interactive learning environment into cross-cultural learning creates authentic and immersive learning environments that provide students with a realistic sense of presence. This enhances cross-cultural learning by making objects, people, and situations appear lifelike. Our technological approach fosters interaction among students from diverse geographical and cultural backgrounds within virtual reality learning environments. Students can not only receive information about the target culture but also exchange culture-related information and communicate in real time. Since our approach is convenient and autonomous, it holds immense potential for resolving the common challenges faced by teachers and students in cross-cultural teaching and learning.},

	abstract = {This descriptive study focuses on using voice activity detection (VAD) algorithms to extract student speech data in order to better understand the collaboration of small group work and the impact of teaching assistant (TA) interventions in undergraduate engineering discussion sections. Audio data were recorded from individual students wearing head-mounted noise-cancelling microphones. Video data of each student group were manually coded for collaborative behaviours (eg, group task relatedness, group verbal interaction and group talk content) of students and TA–student interactions. The analysis includes information about the turn taking, overall speech duration patterns and amounts of overlapping speech observed both when TAs were intervening with groups and when they were not. We found that TAs very rarely provided explicit support regarding collaboration. Key speech metrics, such as amount of turn overlap and maximum turn duration, revealed important information about the nature of student small group discussions and TA interventions. TA interactions during small group collaboration are complex and require nuanced treatments when considering the design of supportive tools. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Student turn taking can provide information about the nature of student discussions and collaboration. Real classroom audio data of small groups typically have lots of background noise and present challenges for audio analysis. TAs have little training in how to productively intervene with students about collaborative skills. What this paper adds TA interaction with groups primarily focused on task progress and understanding of concepts with negligible explicit support on building collaborative skills. TAs intervened with the groups often which gave the students little time for uptake of their suggestions or deeper discussion. Student turn overlap was higher without the presence of TAs. Maximum turn duration can be an important real-time turn metric to identify the least verbally active student participant in a group. Implications for practice and/or policy TA training should include information about how to monitor groups for collaborative behaviours and when and how they should intervene to provide feedback and support. TA feedback systems should keep track of previous interventions by TAs (especially in contexts where there are multiple TAs facilitating) and the duration since previous intervention to ensure that TAs do not intervene with a group too frequently with little time for student uptake. Maximum turn duration could be used as a real-time metric to identify the least verbally active student in a group so that support could be provided to them by the TAs.},

	abstract = {Training to run is not straightforward since without proper personalised supervision and planning, people will not improve their performance and will increase the risk of injuries. This study aims to identify the different factors that influence running training programmes, examining the benefits, challenges or limitations of personalised plans. Moreover, this study explores how multimodal, immersive and artificial intelligence technologies can support personalised training. We conducted an exploratory sequential mixed research consisting of interviews with 11 running coaches from different countries and a survey of 12 running coaches. Based on the interviews and survey analysis, we identified and extracted relevant factors of the training process. We identified four relevant aspects for running training: physical, technical, mental and body awareness. Using these aspects as a reference, we derived a framework using a bottom-up approach. This framework proposes multimodal, immersive and artificial intelligence technologies to facilitate personalised running training. It also allows coaches to personally guide their athletes on each aspect. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Running is a popular sport that provides health benefits and is practised by many people around the world. Training is a process that enables athletes to improve their development in various aspects of their sport; in the case of running, it helps them to increase their speed and endurance. Personalised training supports the needs and abilities of athletes, by helping them to achieve their potential through individualised activities or programmes. Sports science research indicates that personalised training can be improved by applying technology to tackle its challenges and limitations. What this paper adds We show that personalising the training requires not only focusing on the runners' physical condition but also on their mental, technical and body awareness aspects, where each of them has a different adaptation to training. We show that multimodal and immersive technologies offer suitable and portable ways to measure and target the mental and body awareness aspects during running training. Implications for practice and/or policy This paper presents a list of factors, measures and devices that coaches can use to plan and design their training sessions in a more personalised manner.

	abstract = {To date, extensive work has been devoted to incorporating computational thinking in K-12 education. Recognizing students' computational thinking stages in game-based learning environments is essential to capture unproductive learning and provide appropriate scaffolding. However, few reliable and valid computational thinking measures have been developed, especially in games, where computational knowledge acquisition and computational skill construction are implicit. This study introduced an innovative approach to explore students' implicit computational thinking through various explicit factors in game-based learning, with a specific focus on Zoombinis, a logical puzzle-based game designed to enhance students' computational thinking skills. Our results showed that factors such as duration, accuracy, number of actions and puzzle difficulty were significantly related to students' computational thinking stages, while gender and grade level were not. Besides, findings indicated gameplay performance has the potential to reveal students' computational thinking stages and skills. Effective performance (shorter duration, fewer actions and higher accuracy) indicated practical problem-solving strategies and systematic computational thinking stages (eg, Algorithm Design). This work helps simplify the process of implicit computational thinking assessment in games by observing the explicit factors and gameplay performance. These insights will serve to enhance the application of gamification in K-12 computational thinking education, offering a more efficient method to understanding and fostering students' computational thinking skills. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Game-based learning is a pedagogical framework for developing computational thinking in K-12 education. Computational thinking assessment in games faces difficulties because students' knowledge acquisition and skill construction are implicit. Qualitative methods have widely been used to measure students' computational thinking skills in game-based learning environments. What this paper adds Categorize students' computational thinking experiences into distinct stages and analyse recurrent patterns employed at each stage through sequential analysis. This approach serves as inspiration for advancing the assessment of stage-based implicit learning with machine learning methods. Gameplay performance and puzzle difficulty significantly relate to students' computational thinking skills. Researchers and instructors can assess students' implicit computational thinking by observing their real-time gameplay actions. High-performing students can develop practical problem-solving strategies and exhibit systematic computational thinking stages, while low-performing students may need appropriate interventions to enhance their computational thinking practices. Implications for practice and/or policy Introduce a practical method with the potential for generalization across various game-based learning to better understand learning processes by analysing significant correlations between certain gameplay variables and implicit learning stages. Allow unproductive learning detection and timely intervention by modelling the reflection of gameplay variables in students' implicit learning processes, helping improve knowledge mastery and skill construction in games. Further investigations on the causal relationship between gameplay performance and implicit learning skills, with careful consideration of more performance factors, are expected.},

	abstract = {This study explored the influence of the dynamic assessment of human–computer interactive games on children's language potential. Thirty-seven special children aged 3–7 years were selected to participate in the study. They were divided into three groups according to their scores on the Autism Behaviour Checklist: (1) a non-autism group, (2) a suspected autism group and (3) an autism group. In two stages of static and dynamic assessment, all three groups of children completed language tests under the conditions of no mediated prompt and mediated prompts, and the data generated in the game interactions were processed and analysed. The findings suggest the following: (1) static assessment may ignore children's language potential, while dynamic assessment can measure and differentiate children's potential language development ability; (2) children with ASD need more mediation prompts and are more likely to complete tasks with explicit mediation prompts; (3) children with ASD have weaker language potential, and children with suspected ASD or non-ASD children have homogeneous language potential; and (4) assessors should pay timely attention to and maintain children's learning status and psychological changes. This study demonstrates the importance of human–computer interactive games as a dynamic assessment tool to tap into children's language potential and to determine their proximal developmental zone, which has important implications for teachers in understanding groups with different language abilities. Practitioner notes What is already known about the topic? The traditional language assessment paradigm (static assessment) can only evaluate the learners' current language development ability, while the short-term development potential may not be observed. Different prompts in the mediation strategy can be used as a quantitative assessment paradigm in dynamic assessment. Much of the dynamic assessment in children with ASD focuses on language vocabulary learning outcomes and lacks measurement or quantification of language potential. What this paper adds? Presents a method for the dynamic assessment of a human–computer interactive language game suitable for children aged 3–7 years with ASD. Quantifies the potential level of language skills in children with varying degrees of ASD. Objectively and dynamically compares differences in language development potential between different groups. In dynamic assessment, children's learning status and psychological changes should be paid attention to and maintained in time. Implications for practice, research or policy This paper provides a concrete example of how human–computer interactive games can be used to dynamically assess the language potential of children with ASD. These findings highlight the importance of progressive scaffolds (mediated prompts) in children's language learning, which can help children identify and solve problems in a timely manner. For educational developers, language intervention materials should be prepared in a way that encompasses the different levels of language skills of children with different disabilities, that is, within the individual's zone of proximal development.},

	abstract = {Upvotes serve important purposes in online social annotation environments. However, limited studies have explored the influential factors affecting peer upvoting in online collaborative learning. In this study, we analysed the factors influencing students' upvotes received from their peers as 91 participants utilized Perusall, an online social annotation system, for collaborative reading. The participants were asked to collaboratively annotate 29 reading materials in a semester. We collected student reading behaviours and analysed their annotations with a text-mining tool of Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC). Moreover, conditional inference tree was used to determine the relative importance of explanatory factors to the upvotes students received. The results showed that the high-upvote group made significantly more annotations, posted more responses to others' annotations and displayed fewer negative emotions in annotations than those who did not receive upvotes. The two groups of students had no significant differences in the upvotes given to others, as well as cognitive activities and positive emotions involved in annotations. Moreover, the number of annotations was the determining factor in predicting the upvotes that one could receive in social annotation activities. This study has significant practical implications regarding providing interventions in social annotation-based collaborative reading.Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Social annotations enhance students' reading experience, facilitate knowledge sharing and collaboration, promote high-quality learning interactions and ultimately lead to improved performance. In social annotation environments, receiving upvotes from peers is not only a type of feedback but also a form of motivation, social interaction and social validation. No study has explored the influential factors in peer upvoting within social annotation-based learning. What this paper adds This study was the first to examine social annotations through the lens of the community of inquiry framework. We investigated the relationships between students' cognitive and social presence in their annotations and the upvotes they received in an online social annotation environment. Our study revealed the strategies for obtaining upvotes from peers in social annotation-based learning environments. Implications for practice and/or policy The high-upvote group made significantly more annotations, posted more responses to others' annotations and displayed fewer negative emotions in annotations compared to the low-upvote group. The two groups of students did not show significant differences in the upvotes they gave to others or in the cognitive activities and positive emotions involved in annotations. The number of annotations was the primary factor predicting the number of upvotes received in the collaborative reading. This study could inform the design of future online social annotation systems to better support collaborative learning and peer interaction.},

	abstract = {Recently, alternate reality games (ARGs) have been applied in museum learning to encourage learners' active engagement through playful problem-solving activities. However, most learners have insufficient prior knowledge and metacognitive skills to complete the learning tasks in such games. To support learning with ARGs, there is a need to provide proper feedback so that the learners are capable of self-regulated learning and solving the problems encountered during the learning process. Considering the influences of individual differences, this research developed a chatbot as a learning partner in ARG-based learning to support students’ learning with adaptive feedback in a museum. A quasi-experimental study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness with and without the proposed approach. The results showed that the AI-based chatbot approach could significantly improve learners' metacognition awareness, emotional engagement and behavioural engagement. Besides, it is helpful to facilitate students' double-loop learning.Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Alternate reality games (ARGs) enable students to interact with real-world contexts. The complexities of real contexts and ambiguities of the ARGs could frustrate students and demotivate their engagement in problem-solving activities. Conventional corrected feedback may fail to match individual students' requirements in solving encountered problems. What this paper adds An AI-based chatbot was designed as a smart learning partner to support the students in solving encountered problems. The experimental results showed that the proposed approach improved students' metacognitive awareness and engagement. A drawing analysis and a behaviour sequential analysis were applied to further examine the students' perceptions and behavioural patterns. Implications for practice and/or policy It is potentially worth integrating AI-based chatbots into game-based learning to promote students' metacognitive awareness and engagement. AI-based chatbots provide adaptive feedback to effectively facilitate students' self-regulated learning and double-loop learning.},

	abstract = {Teacher education has begun to embrace the use of 360 videos to improve preservice teachers' (PSTs) engagement and immersion. While recent research on such use is promising overall, there are specific questions that have been left unanswered about the construct of presence in 360 videos. More specifically, research has yet to fully explore how video delivery devices and PST characteristics may impact presence. The purpose of this study was to respond to this gap in the literature by examining PST major, delivery device (ie, head mounted display vs. flat screen), and the interaction between the two in informing presence. A total of 93 PSTs watched 360 videos and then completed a questionnaire. Findings indicated that presence in head-mounted displays was related to emotions and agency. Conversely, presence with flat screens meant familiarity and control. Moreover, PST major was a predictor of presence, suggesting that 360 videos should be personalized according to PST career and professional goals. Finally, the interaction effect of preparing to teach K-12 mathematics and wearing a head-mounted display had a negative and statistically significant effect on participants' perceived presence, thus indicating a non-cumulative effect. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic 360 videos are increasingly used to support preservice teacher training. 360 videos for teacher education foster immersion, presence, and noticing skills. What this paper adds Empirical evidence that 360 videos experienced with head-mounted display facilitate agency and emotional involvement. Empirical evidence that 360 videos experienced with flat screens facilitate feelings of control. Data showed that preservice teachers' content area (math) was a positive predictor of presence in 360 videos. Implications for practice and/or policy Head-mounted displays show promise as a delivery mode for 360 videos in teacher education. 360 videos should be personalized according to PST career and professional goals. The eXtended Reality Presence Scale is confirmed as a robust instrument to measure presence in immersive environments. More research is needed to evaluate the scalability of this approach in other contexts.},

	abstract = {Help seeking has traditionally been studied in face-to-face settings using self-report instruments measuring learners' internal inclinations for help seeking (eg, perceived benefits and threats). Much less is known about help seeking in online learning. Furthermore, external environmental factors such as a positive climate were found to encourage help seeking. Utilizing peer-help analytics as well as self-report measures, this study simultaneously modelled the structural relationships among students' perceived class climate, internal help-seeking inclinations, help-seeking engagement, participation in peer help and performance in an online class. Results from structural equation modelling indicated that students' perceived goal structure of an online class had a significant influence on their internal help-seeking inclinations, which subsequently affected their help-seeking engagement, participation in peer help and learning outcomes. Instructors of online classes should pay particular attention to fostering a mastery-oriented climate in order to encourage help seeking and improve academic performance. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Help seeking is important for academic success. Due to a variety of individual and contextual factors, students often do not seek help despite the need. Existing research on help seeking focuses on the face-to-face setting and relies on self-report measures. Students' help-seeking inclinations and patterns may differ between in-person classes and the online environment. What this paper adds This study examined help seeking in an online class through self-report measures and objective analytics data. This study modelled the structural relationships among the external climate of an online class, students' internal help-seeking inclinations, engagement in help seeking, participation in peer help and course performance. Structural equation modelling found that the goal structure of an online class influenced students' internal help-seeking inclinations. Online students' internal help-seeking inclinations affected their grades through their participation in help seeking. Implications for practice and/or policy A mastery-oriented class climate elicits online learners' positive help-seeking inclinations while discouraging negative ones. The design and teaching of online classes should aim to foster a mastery-oriented climate. Online classes should offer peer-help opportunities and encourage student participation, which is conducive to academic performance.},

While studies have explored various socio-emotional learning outcomes, learners’ psychological safety has yet to be explored as healthcare professionals engage in collaborative problem-solving. To address this gap, the qualitative study employed semi-structured interviews to understand occupational therapy students’ (N = 10) perceptions of psychological safety as they engaged in an online learning class. The resulting themes of this study described the feelings associated with different forms of interactions requiring psychological safety: (a) being vulnerable, (b) fear of being misunderstood, (c) need to protect/protection, and (d) group cohesion. The findings have implications for online learner-learner interactions and computer-supported collaborative learning. For example, learners discussed how the perceived permanence of online learning lead to a sense of self-preservation and reticence to discuss the ill-structured and potentially controversial nature of complex problems. Additional aspects of psychological safety in online learning highlighted the importance of shared experiences, learning from failure, and community building.},

Two questionnaires were employed as the main instrument to collect the data from 122 higher education students. The findings indicate that five of twelve hypotheses were supported. Following the result, it is known that perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness significantly affects attitude toward use, perceived usefulness significantly affects teamwork quality, and attitude toward use significantly affects collaborative results. The other seven hypotheses that failed to be supported can represent the important activities and related features that need to be highlighted in designing a virtual museum used in storytelling under collaborative design. Therefore, it will help educational practices to design the features in the app matched by activities in collaborative and storytelling.},

Mind mapping is an active learning strategy for graphically presenting radiant thinking to culture clinical reasoning. The purpose of this study was to explore whether students’ comprehensive diagnostic skills are enhanced through increased student engagement by employing mind mapping. Methods  We implemented mind mapping in small-grouped workshops with 86 junior undergraduates from preventive medicine program, for physical diagnostic sessions including physical examination (PE) maneuver, electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation and medical history collection. We also conducted assessments of the above skills, as well as online surveys regarding their expectation on this course, self-evaluation of mind mapping in teaching and the learning process of all the modules. Results  Group members employing mind mapping in all PE sessions obtained higher scores in the heart and lung systems during the PE maneuver exam. Similarly, groups that made more in-depth mind maps achieved higher scores on the ECG quiz. In addition, groups displaying mind maps for history taking from normal classes and reformed class exhibited greater completeness of medical history with both standardized patients and real patients, which was consistent with increased collection of accompanying symptoms. Mind mapping was valued by the majority of students for its benefits in terms of acquiring PE maneuver, theoretical knowledge, medical history collection and medical records writing, clinical reasoning, communication skills, sense of teamwork and cooperation, professionalism and humanistic literacy. Discussion  The visual feature of mind mapping evoked extensive behavioral engagement in all groups, as did cognitive and emotional engagement, as the majority of students expressed their willingness and affective reactions. In the short term, the positive feedbacks encourage growing engagement. The continuous benefits of mind mapping require long-term observation.},

Aim:  This study responds to calls for empirical investigation concerning the affordances and encumbrances of ADWTs, and their implications for academic integrity.
Methods:  Using a cross-sectional survey research design, we recruited through snowball sampling 100 graduate students and faculty members representing ten disciplines. Participants completed an online survey on perceptions, practices, and policies in the utilization of ADWTs in education. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) helped us understand the factors influencing the acceptance and use of ADWTs.
Results:  The study found that teacher respondents highly value the diverse ways ADWTs can support their educational goals (perceived usefulness). However, they must overcome their barrier threshold such as limited access to these tools (perception of external control), a perceived lack of knowledge on their use (computer self-efficacy), and concerns about ADWTs’ impact on academic integrity, creativity, and more (output quality).
Conclusion:  AI technologies are making headway in more educational institutions because of their proven and potential benefits for teaching, learning, assessment, and research. However, AI in education, particularly ADWTs, demands critical awareness of ethical protocols and entails collaboration and empowerment of all stakeholders by introducing innovations that showcase human intelligence over AI or partnership with AI.},

Technology-based accounting learning is very important because, currently, the accounting profession is very much affected by rapid technological change which means that it must adapt to remain relevant in the business world. This study aims to examine the role of the mediating effect of task-technology fit (TTF) on the relationship between the use of VR and learning outcomes for accounting studies. This research model states that the use of VR will be able to increase TTF, technology quality and accessibility, and then increase reflective thinking and reduce cognitive overload thereby increasing perceived learning effectiveness (PLE). The hypotheses derived from this model were tested empirically using survey data from 199 users of VR engaged in accounting studies. The data analysis uses partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), and the results support the hypothesis that TTF mediates the relationship between VR use, learning behavior, and PLE.},

	abstract = {Background  The traditional face-to-face of medical education is gradually being replaced with online education. However, the rate of adoption of online continuing medical education (OCME) as a learning method among practicing clinical physiotherapists (PTs) is unclear. The objectives of this study were to measure the satisfaction with, attitudes towards, and impact of OCME among practicing clinical PTs in Saudi Arabia (SA) and to examine the factors that affect the findings for satisfaction, attitude, and impact towards OCME.
Methods  This cross-sectional survey was conducted between October 2021 and January 2022. PTs employed at various medical facilities and specialties in Saudi Arabia completed an online survey to assess satisfaction with, attitudes towards, and impact of OCME.
Results  Of the 127 participants, 48 were female (37.8\%), 44.1\% were aged between 24 and 30 years. Overall, 57.5\% of the respondents were satisfied with OCME compared with conventional face-to-face education, and 45.7\% agreed and 18.1\% strongly agreed that OCME was more flexible. Further, 52.8\% of the respondents thought that OCME programs could supplement traditional face-to-face education. The majority of the participants (63.8\%) agreed that participating in OCME programs increased their knowledge, and 55.1\% and 51.2\% agreed that attending these programs improved patient outcomes and increased their confidence in patient management, respectively. However, only 38.6\% agreed that participating in OCME programs enhanced their clinical expertise. The mean satisfaction, attitude, and impact scores differed significantly according to age group, marital status, number of years of practice, and specialty (p {\textless} 0.0001). Multiple regression analysis showed that older age was independently associated with better satisfaction and more positive attitudes and impact. Further, having a specialization also seemed to improve the impact of OCME.
Conclusion  The PTs were satisfied with and had positive attitudes towards OCME, and also found that it had a positive impact on their clinical practice. Thus, existing OCME programs are a good option for expanding the number of PTs proficient in clinical care.},

An emerging type of mobile application is designed to facilitate test takers’ performance in a high-stakes speaking test (e.g., the International English Language Testing System (IELTS)). Such an exam-oriented mobile application provides customized learning opportunity with automatic feedbacks through artificial intelligence (AI) technology for users to enhance their speaking skills. This study aims to explore the attitudes of test takers on using exam-oriented mobile application to adapt in testing environment as influenced by their perceptions through the theory of Technology Acceptance Model. 235 Chinese IELTS test takers with experience of using such applications were invited to fill out an online questionnaire. Collected data were analysed through statistical method, textual analysis, word cloud approach, and sentiment analysis. Results revealed that test takers’ perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use towards the exam-oriented mobile application explained their attitudes to use such an application. They also expressed the concern of personalized AI function to support speaking test adaptation. Implications for educators, test taker, and application developers are provided.},

	abstract = {Despite growing interest in exploring the application of chatbots in language education, studies on the process of chatbot-assisted language learning are scant. This qualitative study uses activity theory to understand how English as a foreign language students engage with a chatbot, Argumate, when composing argumentative essays. Five Chinese undergraduate students performed an argumentative writing task with the assistance of Argumate. Screen recordings capturing the students’ writing processes, chat logs between the students and Argumate, the students’ argumentative essays, and their responses to a post-task questionnaire survey were collected and analysed. The results indicated that the students formed a learning community with Argumate in which they used various mediating tools, including online information sources, notes, translation tools, and typing assistants, to facilitate their interaction with the chatbot. Additionally, the student–Argumate collaborative writing was shaped by rules associated with meeting task requirements and following argumentative writing conventions. At the same time, the students’ need for additional scaffolds beyond those offered by Argumate posed challenges to their collaboration. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the complex interplay among students, chatbots, and other key elements in the activity system of chatbot-assisted writing and generate insights into the application of chatbots to writing pedagogy.},

The available literature on error climate indicates a paucity of research on the effects of perceived error climate on social aspects such as student–teacher relationships. Aims: The aim of this longitudinal study was to examine the relationship between error climate and alienation from teachers. Samples: We conducted a study with two measurement points in primary school (Grade 5 in 2017 and Grade 6 in 2018) and two samples (N = 406 students in 29 classes in Switzerland and N = 345 students in 39 classes in Luxembourg).
Methods: For scrutinizing the effect of error climate at T1 on alienation from teachers at T2, we used hierarchical linear modelling (students nested within classrooms).
Results: For both samples, the results indicated that a positive error climate at T1 predicted less alienation from teachers at T2. We also found an effect of the shared error climate on alienation from teachers.
Conclusions: The findings provide empirical evidence of the importance of improving how errors are handled in the classroom to prevent students' alienation from their teachers.},

	abstract = {In the modern world, there are an enormous number of changes due to the COVID19 pandemic. This fact influences all areas and, in particular, music education. The connection between the pandemic and changes in music education related to oboe teaching will be considered in this work. The research investigates the correlation between music education (oboe teaching) and education modes (offline and online). This correlation was tested for veracity by using statistical analysis of data sets (Student and Shapiro-Wilk tests). These data sets were obtained using a survey that evaluated practice and theoretical skills. The participants were categorized into two distinct groups for this investigation: the control group, characterized by offline education during the experimental phase, and the experimental group, which encompassed both offline and online educational modalities. The survey contained different tasks that illustrated students’ evaluations of their improvements in learning to play the oboe. A fundamental objective of this study involves substantiating the conjecture that online education, particularly in the context of the pandemic, exerts an adverse impact on oboe pedagogy. It was shown from the results (teachers’ interviews) that some problems (like lack of connection with teachers, problems related to self-education, and students’ cheating) have a negative impact on learning to play the oboe, especially on practice skills. However, most of the students evaluated their improvements at a high level, but this perspective lacked empirical basis. It should be noted that there was some improvement in theoretical knowledge, but almost all teachers thought this fact was related to cheating. It also should be noted that students evaluated their skills in the period of offline education lower than teachers.},

The results showed that research on the application of chatbots in HE has gained momentum in recent years. Most studies used the quantitative research methods, followed by mixed methods. Chatbots were primarily created on web platforms for text-based communication, though few explored hybrid channels (text, voice, images) for enhanced interaction. Chatbots are used for teaching, customer service, and mental health support in HE. Users’ behavioral intention, perceived usefulness, ease of use or communication, design, interactivity, social influence, service quality, digital literacy, privacy and security, and ethical issues are some of the factors and concerns that influence the acceptance of chatbot in HE. Common research issues were correlational and cause-effect studies, learner perceptions, technology acceptance, engagement, learning performance, user satisfaction, and self-efficacy. However, areas such as cognitive load and higher-order thinking remain underexplored. Suggestions for improving chatbots to enhance teaching and learning and address concerns are offered for researchers, educators, and chatbot developers.},

              Socially shared regulation of learning (SSRL) is a crucial process for groups of learners to successfully collaborate. Detecting and supporting SSRL is a challenge, especially in real time, but hybrid intelligence approaches such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents may make this possible. Leveraging the concept of trigger events which invite SSRL, we present a design of an AI agent, MAI, which can detect SSRL and prompt students to raise their group‐level metacognitive awareness with the aim of facilitating SSRL. We present the methodology we used to design MAI, drawing on the Echeloned DSR (eDSR) Methodological Framework and making use of the Wizard of Oz prototyping paradigm. We likewise present empirical results evaluating our initial prototype of MAI, using lexical alignment between speakers as a quantitative measure of the effect of MAI's prompts on facilitating SSRL, the Partner Model Questionnaire as a quantitative measure of perceptions of MAI, and interviews as qualitative context for these perceptions. We found that the first prototype of MAI did not facilitate SSRL as hoped, possibly owing to mixed perceptions of MAI's reliability and lack of clarity about MAI's role in the collaborative learning task. From these findings, we offer revised prompts for the next iteration of prototyping this agent and a refined set of design requirements for future development of metacognitive AI agents for supporting SSRL.

                        Socially Shared Regulation of Learning (SSRL) is recognized as a critical component for the success of collaborative learning, emphasizing the importance of group‐level regulatory processes in achieving shared goals, enacting strategies and monitoring learning progress.
                      
                      
                        Supporting SSRL in face‐to‐face collaborative learning environments presents challenges, including the complexity of coordinating and synchronizing individual contributions and regulatory actions within a group context.

                        This paper introduces the design of Metacognitive Artificial Intelligence (MAI), a novel AI system aimed at enhancing Human‐AI collaboration for supporting and augmenting SSRL processes.
                      
                      
                        Through empirical research, the study offers lessons learned and design considerations for developing artificial agents on facilitating and enhancing SSRL among learners, demonstrating how AI can play a pivotal role in collaborative learning environments.

In this research, we developed a technology‐based critical discussion platform to support middle school students' argumentation, with a focus on evidence‐based reasoning and perspective taking. A feasibility study was conducted to examine the patterns of group interaction and individual students' contributions to the critical discussion and their perceptions of the critical discussion activity. We found that more students used text‐based communications than audio, but students who used audio collaborated with each other more frequently. In addition, student engagement in argumentative discourse varied greatly across groups as well as individuals. At the end of the discussion, most groups provided a solution that integrated both sides of the controversial issue. Survey and interview results suggest an overall positive experience with this technology‐supported critical discussion activity. Using the insights from our research, we develop a conceptual dialogue analysis framework that identifies relevant skills under the argumentation and collaboration dimensions.

	abstract = {Das Internet bricht etablierte Praktiken der Unterrichtsvorbereitung auf. Neue Akteure werden sichtbar und die Rolle der staatlichen Regulation wird infrage gestellt. Wie finden Lehrpersonen an Schulen Unterrichtsmaterialien und wie gehen sie mit selbst entwickelten Materialien um? Eine large-scale Untersuchung mit 1.960 Lehrpersonen aus Deutschland erfasst ihre Handlungspraktiken mit Blick auf die Informationsquellen und Formate der Kollaboration. Die Ergebnisse bestätigen vorliegende Befunde, wonach Lehrende Materialien aller Art in den Weiten des Internets – vor allem über «Google» – suchen. Sie sammeln, entwickeln diese für sich und tauschen sich kaum mit Kolleg:innen aus. Für die weitere Entwicklung eines informationellen Ökosystems für Bildung, das schulübergreifend einen Rahmen für Lehren und Lernen in Schulen schafft, gilt es, das Zusammenspiel der Akteure neu auszurichten. Neben der Bereitstellung von offenen Materialien durch private und staatliche Anbieter:innen kommt insbesondere der kollaborativen Erarbeitung und (Nach-)Nutzung eine besondere Bedeutung zu.},
