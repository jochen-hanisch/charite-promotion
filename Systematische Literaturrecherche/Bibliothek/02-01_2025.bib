This study examines the use of educational technology in early childhood education centers and analyzes the factors that influence its implementation. We employed an online survey to assess the technological resources, professional development, media literacy, and attitude toward educational technology of 247 early childhood educators. The results indicate that the use of educational technology is largely dependent on the educators’ media literacy and attitude toward technology. An indirect effect via media literacy additionally explains the association between educators’ professional development and the application of educational technology. The study highlights the importance of targeting training programs and improving technological infrastructure to facilitate the effective implementation of educational technology in early childhood education.},

Despite its potential, effective synergy between collaborative digital tools and reflective learning strategies remains underexplored in classroom practice. This study investigates the effects of integrating collaborative wikis and the Know–Want–Learn (KWL) framework on cognitive development and learning motivation among fifth-grade students in Jember, Indonesia. Using a quasiexperimental design with a mixed-method approach, the study involved 120 students assigned to experimental and control groups. Data were collected via pre- and post-tests, motivation questionnaires based on the ARCS model, classroom observations, and interviews. ANCOVA results revealed a significant increase in cognitive scores in the experimental group (F(1,117) = 28.59, p {\textless} 0.001), with motivational improvements noted across all four ARCS components. These findings demonstrate that the integration of wikis and KWL promotes reflective, collaborative, and engaging learning. The study contributes to the development of context-sensitive pedagogical models, particularly valuable for under-resourced primary education settings.},

Little is known, however, to what extent joint attention can also be differentially instructed guiding shared and mutual gaze. To determine if joint attention can be effectively instructed for, we conducted a 2×2 experimental laboratory study with the factors shared gaze instruction (with versus without) and dyadic gaze instruction (with versus without), consisting of 47 dyads (n = 94). Participants discussed the impact of social media use supported with a concept map on a digital whiteboard. We built on a multi-modal learning analytics framework to analyze participants’ behavioral responses via EDA and gaze tracking measurements. The results revealed that instructing for dyadic gaze reduces shared attention. Furthermore, there are differential correlations between shared moments of arousal and joint attention. Overall, joint attention instruction can guide learners’ focus in CSCL settings.},

	abstract = {Smart technologies, specifically wearables are cutting edge innovation of design science with an emerging Artificial Intelligence (AI) capability for sustainable healthcare. Wearable IoT (w-IoT) applications, solutions and systems can promote early warning measures for physiological parameter monitoring and other vital health observation while addressing, streamlining and enhancing emergency response procedures in the provision and deliverance of healthcare services. These solutions exhibit real-time responses with underlying machine-learning (ML) methodologies alongside ubiquitous, context-aware, pervasive and advance software features. AI frameworks, for the development and implementation of solutions are well covered in this study adopting design science (DS) principles for new product development (NPD), comprising various healthcare scenarios for distributed numbers and environments. Physiological or health activity-related data produced by embedded optical smartwatch sensors can instigate sustainable and economical health-oriented solutions for continuous monitoring, semantic predictions for constrained, intractable and autonomous environments to address cardiac disorders. This paper addresses, the practical implementation of the w-IoT health technology solution prototype for real-time applicability, covering problem identification and utilizing design science guidelines, evaluation and contribution by emphasizing on the experimental stage in general and with specificity. It covers performance results rendering research science communication on machine learning models for time series analysis, regression and classification to implement defined and adaptive thresholds, adopting standard deviation and moving average, computing mean square error (MSE), root mean square error (RSME) and mean absolute error (MAE) values, utilizing exponential moving average results on multiple features, prominently targeting resting heartrate data. Machine Learning algorithms for classification with higher F-score or performance metrics adopted are Decision Trees (DT), K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), XGboost, One-class SVM and Logistic Regression. In Binary classification, KNN achieved F-score of 91 \%, followed by DT at 81 \% which seems an effective algorithm with flexibility on overfitting with high accuracy result. This study will cover all stages of design science methodology, guidelines for w-IoT healthcare solution development, by presenting experimental prototype towards pipeline implementation to address healthcare needs, alleviating previously prevalent Body Area Networks (BANs) solutions precision with advancing w-IoT smart technologies or Wireless Body Sensor Networks (WBSNs).},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a novel architecture, the Great Individual TuTor Embodiment (GITTE) architecture, designed to generate highly personalized embodiments of Intelligent Learning Assistants (ILAs) through an iterative, participative approach. By leveraging Generative Artiﬁcial Intelligence (GenAI) models, the system dynamically adapts design features based on individual preferences, including those that are unconscious or explicitly rejected. The Pedagogical Agents-Level of Design (PALD) model serves as a structured taxonomy to collect and analyze design features at multiple levels, supporting systematic tracking of potential biases and hallucinations that may arise during image generation. To ensure compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the GITTE architecture emphasizes local data processing, and pseudonymization, thus protecting student privacy while enabling real-time, dialogue-based exploration of embodiment preferences. The architecture’s modular design supports ﬂexible integration of GenAI components, demonstrated by the seamless transition from one version of a Large Language Model to another without compromising functionality. A technical proof of concept validates the feasibility of creating ILAs that reﬂect the diverse design requirements of students, highlighting the system’s ability to account for age, gender, and other attributes. Iterative feedback loops further reﬁne each embodiment, leading to continuously improved personalization. Nevertheless, ongoing challenges remain, including mitigating bias and improving scalability. Future research aims to expand the dataset for bias detection, optimize feedback processing mechanisms, and reﬁne the PALD model to better collect nuanced design features, thereby improving the personalization and effectiveness of GenAI-driven ILAs. This approach holds promise for more inclusive, effective and adaptive digital learning experiences.},

The study focuses on identifying the names and functionalities of GenAI tools, as well as librarians’ perceptions and experiences in providing training and applying these tools for literature reviews. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and a survey involving six librarians, desk research to map the functionalities of GenAI tools, and analysis of GenAI training content from a Danish university library. The open and axial coding methods were applied to analyze the interview data. Key barriers identiﬁed include lack of funding, technical expertise, data protection compliance, and trialability. Future research should focus on developing a literature review workﬂow journey map supported by GenAI tools, creating a GenAI evaluation instrument, and establishing an impact assessment framework.},

The proposed approach investigates various hybrid deep learning models, which include CNN-BiLSTM, ANN-BiLSTM, and BERT-BiLSTM, within an educational framework called Interactive, Constructive, Active , and Passive (ICAP). These models classify students’ posts into interactive, constructive, active , and passive categories, which also quantify the cognitive engagement levels from highest to lowest accordingly. We analyzed textual attributes such as sentiment polarity, subjectivity, n-grams, and named entity recognition within the above hybrid models to extract deeper insights into the cognitive content of the forum posts. These features are also further reﬁned using pre-trained BERT embeddings to enhance the classiﬁcation accuracy. In addition to cognitive analysis, we employ Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) based visualization to uncover the underlying themes and topics within the discussion posts. By using hybrid deep learning models for students’ cognitive analysis and LDAbased visualization of discussion topics, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework in improving students’ engagement in online learning.},

Emotional engagement was measured using FaceReader Online, along with quiz questions and follow-up interviews to gauge knowledge retention and perceptions of this educational technology. Results indicate that AI avatars eﬀectively convey content and weakly elicit better recall rates and positive emotional responses comparable to those of real instructors. However, concerns were raised about emotional authenticity and engagement, highlighting the need for improved avatar design. The study concludes with a discussion of the potential and limitations of AI avatars and argues for their thoughtful integration to improve educational equity and learning outcomes.},

Aﬀects are multidimensionally recognized from learners’ voice and facial expressions during a greeting session immediately prior to group work. The multidimensional data are compressed into two dimensions to facilitate eﬃcient integration with other metrics in the group formation process. These two aﬀective metrics, derived from voice and facial expressions, are then combined with traditional metrics such as knowledge level, communication skills, and leadership abilities, resulting in ﬁve metrics that ensure diversity within groups during the grouping process. In a validation experiment involving 34 university students, the validity of recognizing aﬀects from both voice and facial expressions and the extent of information loss during dimensionality reduction are examined. The proposed method is one of the few group formation approaches that take emotional diversity into account, signiﬁcantly contributing to the ﬁeld of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning.},

The chatbot is based on Zimmermann’s SRL framework and is prepared for the MOOC content, basics of computer science. It is designed to support learners in the forethought, performance, and self-reﬂection phases by providing concise, context-speciﬁc responses. A mixed-method evaluation with 79 participants revealed high levels of satisfaction, with over 98\% of respondents recommending the chatbot for future courses. The chatbot proved eﬀective in supporting tasks such as summarization and concept clariﬁcation; however, its role in maintaining motivation emerged as a key area for further investigation. These ﬁndings underscore the transformative potential of AI chatbots in asynchronous learning environments, while also highlighting the importance of incorporating multimodal and motivational features to maximize educational technology (EdTech) impact.},

This semi-automatic and iterative process of labeling the forum posts reduces time for the labeling task and enhances the reliability of the training data to be used in real application of text classiﬁcation. We evaluated our framework on a MOOC course dataset, demonstrating signiﬁcant improvement in model performance.

	abstract = {Effective detection and identification of disruptive talk is of significant practical value for improving collaborative learning quality and optimizing the online education environment. However, existing research on disruptive talk detection often relies on features from a single dimension, making it difficult to comprehensively capture the semantic information of talk and learner characteristics, which limits the detection effectiveness. To address this, we propose a multi-feature fusion model. Based on social cognitive theory, this model captures learner features from multiple dimensions, including the week of discussion, talk length, sentiment polarity of talk content, the speaker’s demographic factors and pre-test knowledge level. At the same time, the model integrates both Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) models, achieving deep fusion of talk semantics and time-series features, thereby enabling more accurate identification of disruptive talk. Experimental results on real classroom datasets show that our method outperforms existing baseline models across multiple metrics, fully demonstrating its effectiveness and practical value. This research not only advances the development of disruptive talk detection but also provides feasible insights for optimizing collaborative learning environments. Future work will explore the scalability of this model in different educational settings and investigate its integration with real-time learning platforms.},

	abstract = {The quality of social interaction in online courses often falls short of expectations, probably due to learners’ difficulties in perceiving the sociality of online learning environments and accessing valid information about others. Group awareness tools (GATs) can address this issue; however, there is little research on GATs specifically designed for online learning communities. Furthermore, different types of awareness are typically provided without meaningful integration. This study introduced an aggregated group awareness tool named SKN in the form of a social knowledge network, which presents a systematic visualization of behavioral, social, and cognitive information about learners within the online community. A quasi-experimental design was employed to investigate SKN’s impact on learners’ perceptions of the online learning environment and social interactions. The experimental group (n = 21) utilized SKN, while the control group (n = 20) did not have access. Results revealed that the experimental group demonstrated significantly enhanced social perceptions of the online environment and engaged in more social interactions compared to the control group. Interviews indicated high levels of satisfaction with the SKN tool, confirming its positive influence on the online learning experience. These findings underscore the potential of aggregated group awareness approaches for enhancing the social attributes of the online learning environment.},

Students from University of Limerick (UL) and Oslo Metropolitan University (OsloMet), used the OpenSimulator MUVE platform for collaboration. The students were divided into four groups comprising a mix of students from both universities. Methodologically, this case study is informed by pre- and post- survey data, screen recordings from two plenary sessions, as well as a final oral presentation and discussion in OpenSimulator. Findings show mixed experiences by the students and point to three pillars of project design that can facilitate CSCL: the platform, the international dimension, and opportunities for collaboration. While students reported that being represented as an avatar had some positive affordances over other video-based platforms, students also faced usability challenges with the platform. In terms of internationalisation and collaboration, students valued working with peers from another country, with their interactions mediated by a platform they otherwise would not have used. Overall, findings show that factors such as time, the usability of the MUVE platform, the assigned task, and the international dimension, are all essential considerations when using a MUVE to facilitate COIL projects.},

However, the application of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in educational practice involves certain challenges, such as thought substitution, superficial cognitive processing, and impaired deep learning. Consequently, investigating the influence of metacognitive scaffolding on deep learning within the GenAI context was the central focus of this study. This study employed a quasi-experimental research design to investigate the impacts of metacognitive scaffolding on learners’ learning approaches, cognitive proficiency levels, and academic achievements in a GenAI learning environment, thereby elucidating the ability of metacognitive scaffolding to promote deep learning. The Mann‒Whitney U test was used to examine the disparities in learning methodologies and academic performance between the experimental and control groups. The SOLO cognitive level framework was used to code transcripts of the dialogs between learners and GenAI, and epistemic network analysis was employed to examine the distribution of cognitive levels between these two groups. These findings revealed that for the learners in the experimental group, the use of metacognitive scaffolding had a significantly positive deepening effect on their tendencies toward various learning approaches and on their cognitive hierarchy. Moreover, the experimental group exhibited better academic performance.},

This study examines how flexibility inherent to emergency remote online learning shapes how Israeli university students from different social groups experienced remote online learning during the Covid-19 pandemic. We thematically analyzed semi-structured interviews with 50 undergraduate and graduate students, representing diversity in terms of class, gender, and national categories. We found four spatial and temporal factors that shaped students’ ability to harness flexibility to benefit their emergency remote online learning: spatial capital, temporal capital, temporal agency, and temporal intensity. The analysis revealed how such factors were shaped by complex intersections between students’ social identities. This study suggests that higher education institutions should make flexibility inclusive and safeguard students from potential adverse effects by tailoring support to diverse student needs and ensuring consistent access to resources as needed.},

It seeks components and utterances of the community of inquiry and shared metacognition in online collaborative learning environments to bring an instructional design model to the fore. A three-cycle design-based research method was followed in two cases of university students by triangulating the quantitative and qualitative data sources. A coding scheme, the shared metacognition questionnaire, the community of inquiry questionnaire and one-to-one and focus-group interview protocols were used as data collection tools. Quantitative data were interpreted through descriptive, inferential statistics, and an open/selective coding process interpreted qualitative data. The findings pointed out that the community of inquiry framework presented a powerful theoretical ground to investigate and distinguish cognitive, social, and teaching presence episodes from shared metacognition episodes. Orientation-planning, monitoring, and evaluationreflection were proved as three main components of the shared metacognition construct in online collaborative learning settings. This study further advances the specification of each shared metacognition component from the group-related regulative actions and taskrelated regulatory actions. Moreover, a set of six instructional design principles within an instructional design model that combines the components of shared metacognition were put forward. These guidelines are intended to aid practitioners and instructional designers in the development of online collaborative learning activities.},

The purpose of this action research was to implement a self-determination theory-based online unit for mathematics students to improve their motivation levels. A convergent mixed methods action research design was employed to identify changes in the levels of autonomy, competence, and relatedness of the participants in an Algebra 2 course (n = 50) at a fully online school in the northeastern United States. Results from the motivation questionnaire and student interviews indicated a significant increase in competence and relatedness after completing the intervention. While no significant increase in autonomy was evident in the quantitative results, the qualitative findings showed some support for improved autonomy.

We engaged 73 biology faculty experts from institutions across the US in four iterative rounds to identify, rate, discuss, and re-rate ten SLOs for non-majors biology labs on the dimensions of importance, feasibility, and distribution of responsibility between lab and lecture. On average, the panel achieved consensus around eight SLOs as “important.” All of the SLOs were rated as “feasible” under optimal teaching and learning contexts, but the panelists noted that current institutional constraints render some as less feasible. Our analysis suggests that labs share many SLOs with lectures, but there are also some SLOs that are unique to the lab.

            During the COVID-19 pandemic, emergency online learning impeded the pursuit of in-person activities that usually foster successful socialization in higher education. To investigate the effects of online learning on socialization, we asked two exploratory research questions: (1) How and to what extent does the level of socialization change during the first online semester? and (2) To what extent does level of change predict course dropout and academic performance? In our case study, using a sample of new students at a large German university, we ran an autoregressive three-factorial model of socialization (role, relationships, organization) with three measurements taken during the new students’ first semester, which was the second semester in which emergency online learning took place. Our results show that the relationships component of socialization did not increase over the semester, while the role and organization components increased. Furthermore, our results support a negative effect of the organization component of socialization on course dropout and a positive effect of the relationship component of socialization on academic performance.

            Zusammenfassung
            Während der COVID-19-Pandemie beeinträchtigte der Notfallfernunterricht die Durchführung von Präsenzaktivitäten, die normalerweise die Sozialisierung im Hochschulbereich fördern. Wir untersuchten, wie sich die Sozialisierung während des ersten Online-Semesters verändert und inwieweit diese Veränderung den Kursabbruch und die akademische Leistung vorhersagt. In einer Fallstudie mit Studienanfängern einer deutschen Universität analysierten wir ein autoregressives Modell mit drei Faktoren der Sozialisierung (Rolle, Beziehungen, Organisation), basierend auf drei Messzeitpunkten. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass nur die Faktoren Rolle und Organisation anstiegen. Weiterhin ergab sich ein negativer Zusammenhang zwischen dem Faktor Organisation und Kursabbruch sowie ein positiver Zusammenhang zwischen der dem Faktor Beziehungen und der Studienleistung.},

Additionally, qualitative research was conducted to examine parental perceptions of technology in general and its implementation within educational settings, encompassing both everyday routines and periods of crisis. The findings demonstrate that ultra-Orthodox parents’ expressed reservations about almost any form of technology adoption in their children’s elementary schools.

This article investigates the real-time control decision-making issues in UAV swarm adversarial interactions. First, an adversarial simulation environment for UAV swarms is constructed, which effectively uniﬁes the environment and state representation, enhancing the response speed of our UAVs. Second, a distributed UAV swarm collaborative control algorithm based on multi-agent reinforcement learning is proposed, and an effective sparse reward function is designed to guide UAVs in adversarial gaming, making the UAV strategies more aggressive, enhancing the adversarial intensity, and further optimizing the control strategy to meet real-world demands better. Finally, the real-time performance and scalability of the proposed method are validated through simulations.},

	abstract = {The optimal selection of massive open online course (MOOC) platforms is crucial for all new and prospective learners. A decisionmaking problem arises when similar choices are available for courses offering similar sets of skills. Evaluating different MOOCs’ attributes solely upon influence or gut feelings invokes bias and might not yield optimal results. Thus, to save time, money, and resources, developing a model for the rational selection of MOOC platforms is crucial. This study was set experimentally, and the aim was not only to elicit the most important MOOC attributes available on each website but also to differentiate between the decisionmaking process of selection and evaluation. Using a hybrid multiattribute decision-making (MADM) approach i.e. Decision-making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory and Analytic Network Process (DEMATEL-ANP) the study has ranked seven critical attributes of MOOCs in order of importance and established causal relations among them. The results also portray the importance of these attributes in selecting the most appropriate e-learning platform.},

	abstract = {Collaborative argumentation is a crucial learning activity affected by various factors, including the use of argumentation elements, encountered challenges, and social regulation. Few studies examined how these factors collectively impact argumentation outcomes based on fine-grained process data. This research employed Chi-squared tests and epistemic network analysis (ENA) to reveal the different frequencies and patterns of these factors in 4 high- and 4 low-performing groups. The data were derived from a 90-minute argumentation task involving 55 undergraduates. The Chi-squared test revealed the frequency differences, indicating that high-performing groups tended to use strong claims, whereas low-performing groups typically used weak counterclaims/rebuttals and encountered more socioemotional challenges. The ENA results further illustrated the differences in the cooccurrences of these factors. In low-performing groups, weak counterclaims/rebuttals intertwined with socioemotional and cognitive challenges. Although students attempted to use socioemotional regulations to address challenges, their efforts were ineffective due to the tense atmosphere. Conversely, high-performing groups successfully alternated between cognitive and socioemotional regulations to formulate strong claims and overcome challenges. These findings highlight the advantages of using ENA to analyze and compare patterns of factors and suggest the need to design educational tools to support effective social regulations.},

The results reveal consensus on the importance of debriefings, a shared emphasis on creating a space for self-reflection on practice in groups across practice areas.

As part of this framework, we established a competence grid for student teachers to assess and support individualizing students’ learning paths.

	abstract = {Within our increasingly diverse higher education classrooms, nurturing learning through strategies and environments that foster inclusion and belonging has become imperative. In the post-pandemic move back to in-person teaching, a shift from online and often asynchronous modes of course delivery, both lecturers and students have encountered opportunities and challenges that present themselves when our embodiment is both perceived and felt within the educational encounter. Early in 2024, I lectured an undergraduate module in the Study of Religions, the course is positioned at an intersection of religion and gender. The module I taught critically engaged with representations of gender and sexuality specifically within Christianity, and the resources and content for the Christianity module were predominantly and intentionally from Feminist, African Feminist, and Queer Theological perspectives. Educators have noted how trust and care, principles embedded in approaches that espouse pedagogical love, promote classroom relations that facilitate active listening, dialogue, and cooperation between both teacher and student. Positioning my teaching and facilitation within the guiding framework of bell hooks’ love ethic, which also centres trust and care (in addition to commitment, responsibility, respect, and knowledge), led to a conscious and intentional weaving of feminist and engaged pedagogies, within my approach to religious studies education, and pedagogical love in the classroom. In this chapter I will be critically reflecting on this experience through (1) my own embodiment and positionality in relation to the students in the classroom, (2) the feminist orientation of the casestudy, the course content and curriculum as guided by a feminist approach to religious studies, as well as (3) the in-classroom teaching and learning engagement strategies used to facilitate learning, understanding, and connection. This critical reflection will be supported by anonymous student feedback received in course evaluations, and my observations of student participation in the classroom.},

	abstract = {The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has prompted a significant shift toward online Education. However, this transition has raised concerns about assessment, distance learning effectiveness, and student workload. These pandemicinduced conditions may also lead to ethical challenges in education. Despite existing research on ethical issues in online education, the focus on ethical challenges related to online formative assessment, especially in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) contexts, is still limited. Therefore, this study aims to explore students’ perspectives on ethical challenges related to online formative assessment. To achieve this objective, a mixed-methods approach was employed. Initially, a qualitative phase involving online focus group discussions was conducted with three distinct groups of eight Iranian EFL learners. These groups encompassed EFL learners from universities, institutes, and schools. Each group participated in a 70-min online discussion to examine the ethical challenges they encountered in online formative assessment following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thematic analysis of the data revealed that ethical challenges could be categorized into three main areas: group work, feedback, and cheating. Subsequently, a ranking scale was employed to determine the primary category that presented the most significant ethical challenge based on students’ viewpoints. The findings indicated that feedback was perceived as the most pressing ethical challenge, followed by issues with cheating and group work categories. Finally, the gathered information was categorized based on the specific learning contexts of the participants. This research provides valuable insights for EFL teachers, policymakers, and educational assessment systems. Based on these findings, it is recommended that EFL teachers and policymakers implement targeted professional development programs, foster a culture of academic integrity, and adopt clear guidelines to address these ethical challenges.},

	abstract = {Learning with virtual reality (VR) can be highly motivating and conducive for cognitive and affective learning outcomes. For commemorative history education, VR enables novel experiences of testimonies co-created by survivors, witnesses, and museums. VR technologies allow learners to feel immediacy and an emotional connection to digitally reconstructed spaces and events of the past. While VR has proven to enhance affective learning outcomes by provoking emotions, interest, or motivation, its perceptual richness may also lead to distraction and cognitive overload. Generative learning activities can alleviate some of the limitations of learning with VR by helping learners to focus on the learning material. This study examines a highly engaging and historical immersive VR application and thereby investigates the effectiveness of the generative learning activities of self-explaining and drawing. Seventy-four undergraduate students explored a three-dimensional representation of the room where Anne Frank, a Jewish girl, was hiding during World War II. For the two experimental conditions, students had to either create drawings of Anne Frank’s room and their own room or verbally explain how Anne Frank’s living conditions would feel for them. For the control condition, students did not engage in a subsequent activity. Based on generative learning theory, we predicted that students engaging in generative learning activities would display higher posttest scores in knowledge and perspective taking than the control group. No such effects were found. Although the VR experience itself increased the ability to empathize with Anne Frank across all groups, it did not contribute to knowledge building. The study results indicate that even without any additional activity, VR can convey highly emotionally engaging testimonies and enables role taking, which suggests that VR is in particular suitable for affective learning.},

	abstract = {Recent research on learning analytics dashboards has focused on designing user interfaces that offer various forms of visualization guidance (often referring to notions such as data storytelling or narrative visualization) to teachers (e.g., emphasizing data points or trends with colour and adding annotations), aiding them in interpreting visual elements to gain a comprehensive understanding of students’ learning processes. Yet, while some studies have explored how teachers interpret students’ data through these dashboards, many have overlooked the diverse technical capabilities of teachers, which can significantly impact their use of LA dashboards. In particular, visualization literacy (VL) skills can greatly influence how effectively teachers interpret dashboards. To the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive account exists that details how teachers with varying VL skills interpret visual representations of students’ data. In this paper, we address this gap by investigating how teachers interpret LA dashboards, both with and without visualization guidance, taking into account their VL. We illustrate this by analyzing teachers’ think-aloud sessions as they engage with dashboards in the context of monitoring synchronous online learning tasks undertaken by student groups using Zoom and Google Docs. Using epistemic network analysis, we examine the differences in interpretations between teachers with varying VL levels. Our findings revealed that teachers with low VL exhibited shallower dashboard interpretations than those with high VL. However, the association of VL with successful task completion rate was not significant. Also, visualization guidance did not enable teachers to deepen their interpretations. While some visualization guidance helped teachers to complete tasks correctly, excessive visualization guidance can also be detrimental.},

	abstract = {Background Traditional anatomy education relies on lectures, visual aids, and cadaver dissections. However, limited cadaver availability often necessitates the use of plastic models to aid 3D understanding. Virtual reality (VR) presents an immersive alternative that may enhance spatial learning without requiring cadavers. Despite its potential, few studies have directly compared VR with traditional methods in anatomy education.
Objective This study aimed to compare the learning outcomes of first-year anatomy students using either VR or plastic 3D models for anatomical instruction.
Methods First-year anatomy students were divided into two groups: one using VR and the other using plastic models. They participated in weekly anatomy sessions consisting of 2-hour lectures followed by 2-hour laboratory sessions covering various anatomical systems. After the lectures, students engaged in laboratory activities using either plastic models or immersive virtual reality (iVR) for 3D spatial anatomy learning, with iVR participants capturing screenshots of assigned targets for verification. Each session concluded with an online image-based multiple-choice quiz to assess anatomical identification and understanding.
Results Students from the Department of Nutrition and Health Sciences (NHS) and the Department of Medical Laboratory Science and Biotechnology (MLSB) at Taipei Medical University (TMU) participated in the study. Students in the VR group initially struggled due to the time required to adapt to the system, which was reflected in their significantly lower scores in week 2 for both NHS (80.35 ± 2.04 vs. 88.82 ± 1.64, p {\textless} 0.0019) and MLSB (72.23 ± 1.81 vs. 88.55 ± 1.67, p {\textless} 0.0001). However, in subsequent weeks, while iVR scores were slightly lower, the differences were not statistically significant, and by the later weeks, there was no significant difference in quiz performance between the two groups, with comparable scores observed in weeks 8 and 10 for NHS.
Conclusions VR provides a viable alternative to plastic models for anatomy education. Although students require an adaptation period, their performance eventually matches that of students using traditional plastic models. This study is the first to quantitatively compare VR and plastic models in anatomy instruction.},

	abstract = {Background The perceptions and learning methods among students have been rapidly changing over the past few years, and thus, there is a need for innovative teaching-learning methods to train the Indian Medical Graduates in the present day.
Objectives The study aimed to assess undergraduate medical students’ perception of reel-making as an innovative teaching-learning method in ophthalmology. Materials and methods This descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted among third-year MBBS students attending ophthalmology clinics in a private medical college in South India in July-August 2024. A total of 64 students were assigned to make educational reels about cataract and myopia awareness for the general public. Their perception and experience of this innovative learning method are collected from students using a pre-validated questionnaire using a five-point Likert scale for 10 questions collected through an online survey. Data was analyzed by chi square, independent t-test and descriptive analysis.
Results 52 out of 64 (81.25\%) students completed the survey. 59.6\% agreed that the reel-making activity evoked more interest in learning, 43.3\% strongly agreed that it was a fascinating activity, 50\% strongly agreed that it perked their interest, 44.2\% strongly agreed that they liked the idea of innovative learning, and 46.2\% strongly felt they would recommend this method to others. Many students used the word “fun” when describing their experience.
Conclusions Innovative teaching through reel-making activity was not only found to spark interest but was also reported to be an enjoyable learning experience among students, and thus could be used as a useful innovative method in medical education. Clinical trial number Not applicable.},

	abstract = {Background Generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) has revolutionized the healthcare system for medical students and their educational process worldwide. Several studies assessed its efficacy in improving medical studies learning, and others assessed medical students’ knowledge and attitudes about generative AI. So, we aim to determine the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of generative AI among medical students in Egypt.
Methods In 2024, a cross-sectional study using a semi-structured questionnaire was performed, targeting 423 students as a convenient sample from 10 selected Egyptian universities by simple random sampling. The questionnaire was distributed via online platforms such as WhatsApp, Facebook, X, Telegram, and Messenger. Data about sociodemographic characteristics, students’ general knowledge about generative AI and its limitations, and their attitudes and practices, respectively, were collected.
Results About 2{\textbackslash}3 (61.5\%) of the studied students had satisfactory knowledge about generative AI and (44.7\%) had a positive attitude. Males demonstrated significantly higher knowledge than females (69.3\% vs. 55\%, P-value = 0.003). Knowledge level also differs significantly by university (P-value {\textless} 0.001), with Suez-Canal and 6th October university students achieving the highest satisfactory scores. Key significant predictors that affect knowledge level include gender, university and study phase according to binary logistic regression results. Furthermore, there is a positive correlation between satisfactory knowledge and Practice level (r = 0.303, P {\textless} 0.001). Finally, most students use generative AI to check Grammar and prepare their homework or assignments.
Conclusion and recommendations There is moderate knowledge and positive attitude about AI that were reflected in medical students’ practice. However, knowledge about AI influenced by gender, university and study phase. Importantly, better knowledge significantly correlates with greater generative AI practice. Offering specialized courses or faculty modules about AI enhance awareness among Egyptian medical students. Such initiatives will enable them to gain knowledge and apply it effectively and wisely.

We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the IRS-RBLO in enhancing the learning outcome and research knowledge among community public health students at Walailak University, Thailand.
Methods This study applied a retrospective record review of 67 complete records out of 80 fourth-year community public health students of Walailak University to study the effectiveness of the IRS-RBLO model through research knowledge and learning outcomes. Research knowledge and learning outcomes were assessed using 40 multiple choice questions and 40 Likert scale questioners, respectively. The T-test was applied to analyze research knowledge before (1st week) and during learning (7th week), and ANOVA statistics to analyze students’ learning outcomes before (1st week), during (7th week), and after (16th week) learning with the IRS-RBLO model.
Results Students exhibited a significant difference in research knowledge (p =.00), with 35.88\% percentage increase in aggregate knowledge assessment score before and during; and learning outcomes before, during, and after learning with the IRS-RBLO model (P =.00), with 17.44\% increase in overall learning outcome increase between the scores of before and after. However, it showed variable results while comparing before and during (P {\textless}.001), before and after (P =.001), and during and after (P =.045) learning with the IRS-RBLO model.
Conclusions The IRS-RBLO model has shown its significant difference in research knowledge and learning outcomes. We recommend the broader implementation of the model, and future research may explore instructor opinions, and investigate educational policy implications to further validate the model’s effectiveness.

This study explored the associations between study demands and resources (decision latitude and social support from lecturers and peers) and different study outcomes by applying the Job Demands-Resources Model in a distance learning context. Based on the model’s assumptions, we hypothesized that academic demands negatively predict study success in distance learning, while decision latitude and social support from lecturers and peers positively affect it. These associations were expected to be mediated by emotional exhaustion and different dimensions of engagement. The cross-sectional online study involved 286 psychology students from a German distance university. The multivariate path model revealed an association of demands and decision latitude with perceptions of competence and study satisfaction. While demands were significantly correlated with the grade point average, decision latitude was not. Consistent with the model’s assumptions, these effects were partially mediated by exhaustion and engagement. We did not find significant incremental associations of social support with the outcomes.

This study, conducted through a qualitative approach, investigates teachers' educational presence and instructional experiences using alternative learning modalities in remote learning. It employed a thematic analysis of data gathered from nine semi-structured interviews, exploring understanding of teachers' educational presence and instructional experiences. The finding highlights two key sections: educational presence when using alternative learning modalities and instructional experiences in using alternative learning modalities. The analysis revealed the emergence of several key themes: (1) meaningful social presence and (2) essential teaching presence in online learning, (3) changing conception of teaching presence, (4) establishing connections in online learning, (5) implementing interactive online activities, (6) integrating educational multimedia materials, (7) employing strategies to promote student interaction, and (8) lastly utilizing diverse assessment strategies. With that, teacher training programs should prioritize the development of essential teaching presence skills, which includes establishing meaningful social connections, promoting active student engagements, and diverse interactive activities and assessment strategies to ensure effective and engaging online learning experiences.},

Current feedback practices have limitations, such as the difficulty for students to formulate understandable feedback for teachers, the effort required for students and teachers to engage in feedback dialogue, and the challenge for teachers to manage multiple feedback responses across a wide range of learning material. Thus, there is a need for computational support in a digital learning environment that facilitates bidirectional feedback creation, processing, and dialogue. To this end, we present a process model of bidirectional feedback, a conceptual design of a computational support to assist this process, and its implementation for the self-assessment task type in Moodle. It was implemented and evaluated in a distance learning course in a B.Sc. Computer Science program. With the use of computer-assisted support for the bidirectional feedback process, an increase in feedback from more students was observed and was related to more self-assessment tasks. Feedback included not only negative but also positive feedback. Teachers confirmed the usefulness of computational support as well as the usefulness and understandability of student-generated feedback messages, both for helping students and for assessing and improving the quality of assignments.},

	abstract = {The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic brought unprecedented challenges to medical education, particularly in teaching practical skills. These challenges catalyzed the adoption of digital and hybrid teaching methods, reshaping traditional teaching approaches. This study evaluates the effectiveness of blended learning, which integrates digital and in-person instructions, for teaching basic practical otorhinolaryngology examination skills and explores factors influencing its success. During the winter semester of 2020/2021, fourth-year medical students at the University of Wuerzburg participated in a blended learning program comprising a digital course with self-guided practice using examination kits, followed by an on-site course, concluding an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE). Students were divided into cohorts based on whether they received supervised clinical teaching prior to the OSCE. Performance data, along with a comprehensive survey covering demographics, preparation, interest, and self-evaluation, were analyzed to identify key factors impacting outcomes. Results revealed that students who underwent supervised clinical teaching scored significantly higher on the OSCE compared to those in the online-only cohort. Notably, gender disparities were observed, with male students outperforming females; however, this gap was mitigated among students with high self-assessed musical abilities. Additionally, selfevaluation of practical skills strongly correlated with OSCE performance, underscoring its importance in psychomotor skill acquisition. Survey findings highlighted the perceived value of the blended approach, with supervised clinical teaching rated as more beneficial than digital-only methods for mastering handson competencies. This study demonstrates that blended learning is an effective strategy for teaching practical otorhinolaryngology skills, offering significant advantages over online-only approaches. However, its success depends on addressing factors such as gender disparities and promoting extracurricular activities, like music, to enhance manual dexterity and confidence. The findings provide a robust framework for integrating hybrid teaching formats into post-pandemic medical education.},

	abstract = {A biopharmaceutical drug discovery project was leveraged as a case study to illustrate a proposed simpliﬁed stakeholder management approach. The driving force underlying this chapter was the lack of effective stakeholder management in projects thought to be a contributing factor to the approximate 50\% project failure rate. Existing stakeholder management techniques in the project management body of knowledge were based on stakeholder theory from the strategic management discipline. This encourages decision-makers to consider the non-related interests of stock shareholders, customers, employees, suppliers, and the local community—such as ethics and social good. Those stakeholders are not necessarily as relevant in projects. In a project, the key stakeholders are those affected by WBS activities and deliverables. Therefore, a new simpliﬁed stakeholder management model was proposed by interviewing a panel of experienced project managers to document stakeholder identiﬁcation best practices. Machine learning, nonparametric Kruskal Wallis, and Chi-Square contingency analysis statistical techniques were applied to analyze the results. The empirical literature was reviewed to inform the development of two models, the ﬁrst for stakeholder analysis and the second for stakeholder engagement. Power and impact were argued to be the two key factors driving stakeholder analysis. A stakeholder engagement model was developed to leverage the stakeholder analysis.},

This chapter aims to illuminate the functioning of these perspectives within collaborative R\&D projects, where outcomes are inherently unpredictable and hinge on complex partner interactions. This chapter seeks to unravel the interplay between equivocality and governance, including the moderating effects of participants’ learning capabilities and their impact on project success, measured by either efﬁciency or value. Consequently, a conceptual framework grounded in the complex adaptive system model is outlined. Through a multiple-case analysis of collaborative R\&D projects, an inductive grounded theory approach is used to gain a deeper understanding of the four cases. Empirical data was gathered through open-ended interviews and archival data. The proposed framework delineates the ﬁndings of this chapter, enhancing comprehension of collaborative R\&D projects by modeling the interactions of governance, equivocality, and organizational learning as a complex adaptive system. From an academic perspective, this framework offers additional insights into the planning and control functions within collaborative R\&D projects. For practitioners, it provides a deeper understanding of management practices and their implications for success, emphasizing the nonlinear interactions among the three constructs.},

            Die Hochschullehre befindet sich in einem Transformationsprozess, in dem Erkenntnisse aus der Online-Lehre der Pandemiezeit mit der etablierten Präsenzlehre verbunden werden. Im Projekt INKULT an der Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg wurden Flipped Classroom (FC)-Modelle für 13 Lehrveranstaltungen aus unterschiedlichen Fachkulturen entwickelt. Der Fokus lag darauf, FC-Modelle zu erstellen, die den besonderen Bedürfnissen verschiedener Fachrichtungen gerecht werden und die Wahrnehmung des FC-Konzepts durch Lehrende und Studierende zu analysieren. Die Untersuchung brachte zentrale Erfolgsfaktoren und Herausforderungen zum Vorschein und unterstrich die Wichtigkeit einer sorgfältigen Veranstaltungsplanung und der Interaktion mit den Studierenden für den Erfolg des FC. Dabei wird betont, dass eine Reflexion über die veränderte Rolle der Lehrenden und die Förderung des selbstgesteuerten Lernens der Studierenden essentiell für den Erfolg des Formates sind. Weiterbildungsmaßnahmen für Lehrende und die Entwicklung metakognitiver Kompetenzen bei Studierenden sind dabei von zentraler Bedeutung. Die Resultate unterstreichen zudem die wesentliche Bedeutung von Ressourcen, sowohl finanzieller als auch personeller Art, für die Implementierung des FC-Ansatzes. Die Implementierung des FC-Konzepts erfordert also eine ganzheitliche Herangehensweise, die organisatorische, didaktische und individuelle Aspekte gleichermaßen berücksichtigt und unterstützt. Durch kontinuierliche Reflexion, kritische Evaluation und iterative Anpassung kann ein Mehrwert durch FC-Modelle für die Lehre generiert werde.},

Folgende Ergebnisse wurden konstatiert: Je nach Ausgestaltung der Lehrveranstaltung ergeben sich positive Effekte auf das studentische Lernen. Portfolio-Prüfungen gehen jedoch mit einem höheren Workload für Studierende und Lehrende einher. Insgesamt wurde das Potenzial von Portfolio-Prüfungen in den Pilotveranstaltungen nicht immer voll ausgeschöpft. Portfolio-Prüfungen sind ein gutes Instrument für Kompetenzorientiertes Prüfen, wenn Lehrveranstaltungen im Sinne von Constructive Alignment geplant und höhere Kompetenzniveaus abgebildet werden. Portfolio-Prüfungen werden daher vor allem für Lehrveranstaltungen, bei denen ein breites Spektrum an Kompetenzen in höheren kognitiven Niveaus erworben werden soll, empfohlen.

              ist ein Programm, das einen Rahmen für die gemeinsame Weiter- und Neuentwicklung von Lehrkonzepten bietet. Es wird als wirkungsvoller Hebel zur Gestaltung der Hochschulbildung verstanden. Das „Hoch drei“ symbolisiert die Kollaboration zwischen Studierenden, Lehrenden und Mitarbeitenden. Mithilfe dieser Zusammensetzung können Fächer- und Hochschulgrenzen durchbrochen werden, wodurch ein co-kreatives, rollenübergreifendes Arbeiten entsteht. Die Lehre wird spielerisch als „kaputtes Spiel“ betrachtet, um Anreize zu setzen, Motivationslücken zu erkennen und neue Ideen zu generieren. Das neunmonatige Programm basiert auf interdisziplinärer Zusammenarbeit, Kreativität und einem forschenden Ansatz zum Lehren und Lernen. Fünf Teams von verschiedenen Hochschulen für Angewandte Wissenschaften (HAWs) haben hierbei Lehrkonzepte entwickelt und verfeinert. Das Ergebnis ist eine kreative Ideenschmiede für die Lehre, die eine Atmosphäre der Wertschätzung und produktiven Kreativität in sich vereint und die Hochschulbildung damit als Gemeinschaftsaufgabe erlebbar macht.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Improving health care quality and patient safety are top priorities for the medical field. Robust continuing medical education (CME) programs represent major interventions to effectively teach quality improvement (QI) principles to practicing physicians. In particular, eLearning, a term describing online and distance learning interventions using digital tools, provides a means for CME interventions to reach broader audiences. Although there has been a focus on CME addressing QI, no knowledge synthesis has focused specifically on eLearning interventions. The purpose of this review was to examine the current landscape of eLearning interventions in QI-focused CME.
METHODS: We conducted a scoping review using the framework developed by Arksey and O'Malley as revised by Levac. We searched five databases and identified 2467 prospective publications, which two authors independently screened for inclusion. From each included article, two authors independently extracted data on the instructional modalities and QI tools used and met regularly to achieve consensus.
RESULTS: Twenty-one studies were included. Most studies used blended instruction ( n = 12) rather than solely eLearning interventions. Salient findings included the importance of coaching from QI experts and institutional support for planning and implementing eLearning interventions. Lack of protected time and resources for participants were identified as barriers to participation in CME activities, with small practices being disproportionately affected.
DISCUSSION: Partnerships between CME developers and sponsoring organizations are vital in creating sustainable eLearning interventions for QI-focused CME. Remote coaching can be an effective strategy to provide ongoing support to geographically separated learners.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In addition to the medical school curriculum, medical students often take the initiative to incorporate external paid digital educational resources, especially during the pandemic. In this study, we organized an exemplary questionnaire method to enable evidence-based decisions before providing paid e-learning resources to medical students.
METHODS: An online form was distributed to all registered medical students at a Turkish medical school, and the compiled responses were subjected to statistical analysis. The participants were queried about their general background, post-graduation plans, use of study materials, purpose and perceived benefits of utilizing paid e-learning resources, as well as any financial burden or opinions regarding the associated costs.
RESULTS: A total of 119 medical students participated in the online form. The findings revealed that 87\% of the participants reported using paid e-learning resources for school exams, with 71.5\% of them indicating an improvement in their exam scores. Approximately 26.1\% of the participants did not specify any change. When asked to rate the cost of using paid e-learning resources on a scale of 1 to 10, the average score was 8.6 ± 1.58. Furthermore, 40\% of the participants relied on repeated free demo sessions, while only 27\% reported paying the fees associated with these resources.
CONCLUSIONS: With the evolution of medical education, particularly in the aftermath of the pandemic, medical students are increasingly seeking to supplement their medical curriculum, pursue self-interests, and engage in extracurricular research by utilizing paid e-learning resources. However, the costs associated with these resources often prevent some students from fully benefiting from them. Therefore, it is essential for medical schools to make evidence-based decisions to support their students, recognizing that digitally available resources play an integral role in the assimilation of medical education.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The digital age has transformed health professions education, making online learning (e-learning) essential for instruction, assessment, and evaluation. However, general surgery residents are dissatisfied with current study methods and routines. As they progress through the new Entrustable Professional Activities (EPA) milestones, adapting content delivery to their learning preferences is crucial for engagement, a key element in the Kirkpatrick training evaluation model. This study explores general surgery residents' experiences, attitudes, and preferences toward e-learning to enhance instruction in the EPA era of surgical education.
METHODS: We used a convergent parallel design, distributing a national survey and conducting semi-structured interviews with general surgery residents from 22 U.S. institutions. The survey examined e-learning resource utilization, satisfaction, and financial investment in medical school and residency. Interviews provided insights into residents' desired features of effective e-learning. Data analysis included comparative statistics for survey results and reflexive thematic analysis for interviews.
RESULTS: The survey was completed by 106 general surgery residents. Residents reported higher satisfaction with e-learning resources utilized in medical school (e.g., UWorld, Sketchy Medical) than those in residency (e.g., TrueLearn, SCORE Web Portal) (mean difference = 0.4, 95\% CI = [0.3,0.5], p {\textless} 0.001). Learners' financial investment in USMLE preparation was significantly higher than for ABSITE (74\% vs. 21\% willing to spend {\textgreater}\$500; p {\textless} 0.001). Separately, 30 general surgery residents participated in semi-structured interviews, which highlighted preferences for mobile learning, multimedia, gamification, and competency-based assessments. Residents noted a gap between current e-learning resources and the EPA assessment paradigm.
CONCLUSIONS: General surgery residents find current e-learning resources in residency lacking clinical relevance and alignment with competency-based assessments. In the EPA era of surgical education, there is a need to develop innovative e-learning platforms that prepare residents for standardized examinations and support clinical competency development. Addressing these gaps will enhance the quality and efficiency of surgical training to better prepare residents for independent practice.},

	doi = {10.3389/fdgth.2025.1455143},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Internet allows cancer patients to access information about their disease at any time. However, the quality of online information varies widely and is often inaccurate or does not provide all the details patients need to make informed decisions. Additionally, patients' often limited ability to find and evaluate cancer-related online information can lead to misinformation.
OBJECTIVE: An interactive e-learning environment to promote digital health literacy will be developed and evaluated for effectiveness.
PRIMARY HYPOTHESIS: Cancer patients who use the e-learning environment (IG1.1-IG1.3) or the content of the environment as a non-interactive PDF file (IG2) will show greater improvement in their digital health literacy from baseline to 8 weeks after baseline compared to patients who receive no such intervention, but are referred to a standard information brochure.
METHODS: The hypothesis will be tested in a stratified randomized controlled superiority trial with five parallel groups and the primary endpoint of digital health literacy. In an e-learning environment, patients will learn strategies to use when searching for reliable cancer-related online information. During development, a prototype will be refined through focus groups and tested for usability by experts and patients. 660 cancer patients will be recruited using convenience sampling and randomly assigned in a 3:1:1 ratio to IG1.1-IG1.3 (three variants of the environment), IG2, or the control group. Two thirds of the 660 participants will be recruited through the German Cancer Information Service (CIS) and one third through non-CIS routes. Allocation will follow stratified randomization, accounting for recruitment route (CIS vs. non-CIS) and cancer type (breast cancer vs. other cancers), with variable block length. The primary outcome, digital health literacy, will be measured at baseline, 2 weeks, and 8 weeks after baseline.
CONCLUSION: If the results support the primary hypothesis, then the e-learning environment could empower patients to retrieve more reliable information about their disease. Concerns about the generalizability of the results, since a disproportionate number of inquiries to the CIS come from breast cancer patients, are addressed by a proportionally stratified randomization strategy and diversified recruitment routes.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly accelerated the adoption of e-learning across educational institutions worldwide, especially in health professions education. This study explored the factors influencing e-learning acceptance among health professions students and faculty members in Iran using an extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among 932 participants, including faculty members, postgraduates, and undergraduates at Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, one of the top five universities in Iran. Data were collected through an online survey from August 1 to August 31, 2020. The TAM was extended by incorporating innovation, social, and organizational characteristics. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was used to analyze the relationships between constructs, including perceived ease of use (PEU), perceived usefulness (PU), and intention to use e-learning. The findings revealed that PEU and PU were pivotal in shaping e-learning acceptance, underscoring the need for user-friendly and effective platforms. Attitude toward e-learning significantly influenced participants' intention to use e-learning platforms, with PEU emerging as the most influential factor. PU had a more substantial impact on faculty members and undergraduate students, while postgraduates placed less emphasis on usefulness. Organizational factors only indirectly affected e-learning acceptance, mediated by individual characteristics. This study underscores the importance of usability, technological infrastructure, and digital literacy training in promoting e-learning acceptance among health professions students and faculty members. These findings significantly impact policymakers, educators, and administrators in designing more user-centered e-learning platforms. Future research should explore the longitudinal effects of technological advancements and institutional policies on e-learning adoption.},

	abstract = {Introduction Focused Cardiac Ultrasound (FOCUS) is an essential tool for rapid cardiac assessment across various clinical subspecialties. Consequently, teaching foundational FOCUS skills is of critical importance. This study investigates the effectiveness of e-learning in imparting FOCUS skills. Materials and methods This prospective, controlled study assessed competency development among medical students attending a FOCUS workshop (study group) at two time points: T1 (pre-training) and T2 (post-training, after completing e-learning). The competence gain of the group was compared to a reference group (control group) of physicians who had also used the e-learning in preparation for a certified FOCUS workshop. Objective competencies were measured at both time points using short-answer and multiple-choice theory tests. Subjective self-assessments of competencies and opinions of the e-learning were investigated through evaluation forms at T2 using a 7-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree). Demographic information was collected at T1, and user behaviour during e-learning was assessed at T2. Primary endpoints were the increase in theoretical competencies (study group) and the comparison of subjective and objective competency levels (study vs. reference).
Results A total of 104 participants (study group = 48; reference group = 56) were included. The study group exhibited a significant (p {\textless} 0.001) increase in theoretical competencies. However, at T2 the reference group achieved significantly higher theoretical test scores (p {\textless} 0.001). One influencing factor was previous practical experience (p = 0.02), which was significantly higher in the reference group (p {\textless} 0.001). Both groups estimated their competency at the end of preparation to be at similar levels (4.3 ± 0.9 scalepoints [SP] versus 4.3 ± 1.0 SP; p = 0.94). Evaluation results of the e-learning were positive in both groups (5.8 ± 0.9 SP versus 6.2 ± 0.7 SP; p = 0.04), with results in the reference group being significantly higher.
Conclusion Both the improvement in competencies and the positive reception of digital learning media should encourage the increased implementation of e-learning formats. This study shows that such formats in ultrasound training can effectively complement face-to-face workshops and should be included in certified training curricula.

	abstract = {Background With rapid advancements in medical sciences, minimally invasive surgical techniques such as laparoscopy have replaced traditional open surgeries. Enhancing the clinical competence and professional commitment of operating room nurses can empower nurses and directly impact surgical outcomes and patient safety.
Methods A quasi-experimental pre-test-post-test control group design was employed. Ninety-four students were selected through convenience sampling and randomly allocated to two groups: an intervention group (n = 47) and a control group (n = 47). The intervention group received five sessions for training on laparoscopic surgical principles using E-learning, video demonstrations, and participatory methods. The control group received training using lectures and PowerPoint presentation. Data was collected using a demographic questionnaire, perceived perioperative competence scale- revised (PPCS-R), and the nursing professional commitment scale (NPCS), before and two weeks after the intervention.
Results There was no significant difference in the mean scores of clinical competence and professional commitment between the two groups at baseline (P {\textgreater} 0.05). After the intervention, the mean score of clinical competence in the intervention group was significantly higher than the control group (p = 0.005). However, there was no significant difference in the mean score of professional commitment between the two groups after the intervention (P = 0.261).
Conclusion Using a combined learning approach in laparoscopic surgery led to a significant increase in the clinical skills of nursing students, resulting in improved performance in the clinical setting. However, to further generalize the results, similar studies with larger sample sizes and in different educational settings are recommended.},

It is important for faculty to use the modality of online learning to understand the influence of student personality traits, defined as relatively stable characteristics that influence thinking and behavior, on student satisfaction and success in graduate level programs. By understanding the influence of personality traits, faculty can better develop online materials that are flexible enough to support individuals who may have a higher risk of low satisfaction and success. There has been plentiful research in the areas of education and psychology assessing the influence of personality on the online learning experience. The goal of this systematic review was to collect, evaluate, and synthesize this literature to provide guidance to faculty working in or developing online courses or programs in occupational therapy. This systematic review was conducted according to the Cochrane Collaboration methodology and reporting is consistent with the PRISMA guidelines. The article search included January 2000 through June 2024. After duplicates were removed 848 articles remained, ultimately 99 were eligible for a full text review, and 23 were included in the three themes which were synthesized based on design and type of online education. The review highlights what is currently known related to the influence of personality type on online education. The information can be used to help sensitize educators to the influence different personality types can have when teaching online courses.},

Rooted in social constructivist principles, these pedagogical approaches foster student engagement, critical thinking, and problem-solving by promoting interactive and group-based learning environments. The study traces the historical development of cooperative learning from early educational theories to contemporary applications, highlighting key figures and models that have shaped its implementation. Additionally, it examines collaborative learning as a distinct but complementary framework that enhances knowledge construction through shared inquiry and digital integration. The paper also explores theoretical foundations such as Vygotsky’s Zone of Proximal Development, Piaget’s Cognitive Development Theory, and theories of group dynamics that inform these methodologies. While cooperative and collaborative learning offer numerous benefits, including improved social skills, academic performance, and motivation, challenges such as group dynamics, assessment complexities, and institutional barriers remain. The findings suggest that integrating these approaches with emerging educational technologies and inclusive teaching strategies can optimize learning experiences, fostering deeper student engagement and success in diverse educational settings.},

Firstly, the demands and wishes of important target groups for digital programs and resources in social work are discussed. Secondly, the text reflects strategies and tools contributing to a successful approach towards especially young people, including first contact, building robust relationships and giving useful advice. Basis for this multi-step discussion is the empirical project evaluation of the digital social work delivered within the Zukunftswelten program provided by Stuttgarter Jugendhaus Gesellschaft. Seven qualitative interviews with project parties involved (including the host institution, the financier and a cooperating social network) and a quantitative content analysis of 155 chat protocols derived from a Digital Streetwork initiative within the social network Jodel allow deep dives into daily working practices. The results show that digital social work is actively demanded by adolescents and young adults. Always Online communication logics and a heavily referential content production culture demand digital social workers to be highly flexible and have advanced knowledge about the scene. Anonymity in virtual worlds makes entering counseling easy and at the same time reduces the engagement of clients. Digital Streetwork substantially fosters professionalization in the field of digital social work, but has on the other hand to further develop its own professional standards and requires permanent linking to existing social support structures.},

Während die aktuelle Literatur viel Wert auf OER legt, wird die Anpassungsfähigkeit digitaler Bildungsressourcen unabhängig von Lizenzfragen weniger diskutiert. Zudem fehlen Daten zur höheren Wirksamkeit von OER im Vergleich zu kommerziellen Bildungsressourcen. Daher wurde auf der Basis pädagogischer und lernpsychologischer Theorien ein theoretisches Konzept mit verbindlichen Kriterien für digitale Bildungsressourcen (DER) aus Lehrerperspektive entwickelt. Eine Delphi-Studie mit Lehramtsstudent:innen und Lehrenden identifizierte in der ersten Runde (N = 69) 19 wichtige Kriterien. In der zweiten Runde (N = 88) wurde die Wichtigkeit der Kriterien beurteilt und dabei festgestellt, dass eine höhere Häufigkeit eines Kriteriums (erste Runde) mit einer hohen durchschnittlichen Zustimmung (zweite Runde) korrelierte, was auf eine starke Zustimmung hinweist. Die drei wichtigsten Kriterien für DER sind Benutzerfreundlichkeit, Adaptierbarkeit und Verständlichkeit. Die kostenlose Verfügbarkeit von digitalen Bildungsressourcen wurde im Vergleich zu anderen Bewertungskriterien als weit weniger bedeutsam eingestuft. Die Ergebnisse der Delphi-Studie zeigen die Notwendigkeit alternativer Konzepte mit eindeutigen Kriterien zur Entwicklung digitaler Bildungsressourcen, die individualisiertes Lernen aus Sicht von Lehrer:innen fördern.

            The aim of this study is to develop a concept for the standardized design of digital educational resources based on binding criteria to promote individualized learning in the classroom. While the current literature places a lot of emphasis on OER, the adaptability of digital educational resources independent of licensing issues is less discussed. There is also a lack of data on the greater effectiveness of OER compared to commercial educational resources. Therefore, on the basis of pedagogical and theories of educational and learning psychology, a theoretical concept with binding criteria for digital educational resources (DER) from a teacherʼs perspective was developed. A Delphi study with student teachers and teachers identified 19 important criteria in the first round (N = 69). In the second round (N = 88), the importance of the criteria was assessed. It was found that a higher frequency of a criterion (first round) was associated with a positive average rating (second round), which indicates strong a agreement. The three most important criteria for DER are ease of use, adaptability and comprehensibility. The free availability of digital educational resources was rated to be far less important compared to other evaluation criteria. The results of the Delphi study show the need for alternative concepts with clear criteria for the development of digital educational resources that promote individualized learning from the teachersʼ perspective.},

            Seit der Covid-19-Pandemie wird den Lehrenden immer wieder empfohlen, das Beste aus den zwei Welten „Online-“ und „Präsenz“-Lehre in die eigene Lehre zu integrieren. Aber woran erkennen Lehrende, an welcher Stelle sich eher analoge, digitale, asynchrone oder synchrone Lehrelemente anbieten? Ziel des Projekts „NewNormal – Kompetenz- und Bedarfsoptimierte Lehrstrategie“ war es, hierfür kriterienbasierte Empfehlungen zu entwickeln. Grundgedanke des Projekts war es, den Digitalisierungsgrad der Lehrvermittlung an den Bedürfnissen der Studierenden, den zu erwerbenden Kompetenzen und dem Studienverlauf anzupassen. Bei den Bedürfnissen werden die drei Grundbedürfnisse soziale Eingebundenheit, Kompetenzerleben und Autonomie nach Ryan und Deci (2000) verwendet. Es wird vermutet, dass diese je nach Phase im Studium unterschiedlich wichtig sind. Erprobt und evaluiert wurden diese Annahmen im Grundlagenstudium des Bachelorstudiengangs Maschinenwesen an der TUM. Die Ergebnisse zeigen unter anderem, dass sowohl die Studierenden als auch die Lehrenden mit der Wahl der Lehrformate zufrieden sind und das Gefühl haben, dass die gewählten Formate gut geeignet für die Vermittlung der jeweilig angestrebten Kompetenzen sind. Darüber hinaus liefern sie Hinweise dafür, dass die Berücksichtigung der Bedürfnisse der Studierenden ein wichtiger Faktor für die Zufriedenheit und Motivation der Studierenden ist.},

	abstract = {This study examines the impact of the game space in Stories of a GeoFarmer, a digital game prototype designed to enhance cultural geography in higher education. Employing the Cybermedia Model, we analyzed student perspectives on how various game design elements inﬂuence learner engagement across four layers: representational, mechanical, material, and player. Our qualitative analysis revealed that representational elements can enhance spatial learning and cultural recognition. At the same time, game mechanics can hinder student perceptions of learning due to complexity and lack of intuitiveness. Material issues such as technical robustness affected the gameplay experience, highlighting the need for improved game functionality. However, player interaction with the game’s objectives led to positive learning outcomes, illustrating the game’s potential as an effective educational tool. The ﬁndings suggest that carefully integrating educational content into game design can signiﬁcantly enhance learning outcomes, particularly in cultural geography education. This study contributes to understanding serious games as versatile educational tools by underscoring the importance of spatial design as a means to maximize student perceptions towards pedagogical effectiveness.},

	abstract = {The main objective of this paper is to report on the impact of a gamebased museum school visit on player experience while solving complex problems about food production. We used a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative analysis of digital traces with qualitative case studies to assess how players engage with the mixed reality game AL2049. The data includes digital traces from 174 games and video recordings collected via on-board cameras. Our results reveal clusters characterizing attitudes towards complexity, identifying four categories of players: Explorers, Rushers, Strategists, and Inactive. Through case studies of these categories, using a dedicated model, we identiﬁed the dimensions that characterize their subjective experiences. This model highlights player experiences across four main dimensions: actions, information processing, knowledge, and emotions. Our results highlight the tension that can arise in game-based learning between the way the game is designed and the way it is played. They also underscore the value of using mixed methods to analyze the player’s experience.},

However, learning special vocabulary about dangerous goods, occupational safety, or internal codes can be tedious due to the need for repetition. Combining learning with the intrinsic motivation and fun of playing digital games, a concept known as serious games, is gaining traction with recent advancements in the gaming industry. Particularly mobile games have become popular due to their accessibility. Despite evidence of the beneﬁts of serious games, the potentials of low-threshold mobile games in vocational training are still underexplored. In this work, we present the results of a study (n = 79) investigating the potentials of a serious low-threshold mobile game called “Sky Dash” to enhance the experience of a repetitive learning task in the context of a large company in ground logistics. We used a between-subjects design with employees working in the baggage handling at an international airport. The ﬁndings underline the users’ appreciation of interactive gamiﬁed learning in comparison to non-gamiﬁed passive learning. Although participants learning with the non-gamiﬁed method performed signiﬁcantly better than those using the gamiﬁed method, it is another major ﬁnding that knowledge gain among participants learning with the game was still signiﬁcant between pre-, post-, and memory tests, and they reported signiﬁcantly more fun.},

Alternative game controllers that enable domain-speciﬁc embodied interactions can thus promote a learner’s intrinsic motivation and technical knowledge as they digitally engage with the ﬁeld of study. Embodied game interactions (EGIs) are mapped interactions that engage the learner directly and physically throughout gameplay, bridging game mechanics with learning mechanics. Applying the technological underpinnings of tangible user interfaces to learning theories and serious game design can augment how learners interact with and understand the material at hand, providing opportunities for near knowledge transfer in real-life situations.},

	abstract = {„Welchen Musikunterricht braucht die Sekundarstufe 1?“ – Diese Frage ist ebenso umfassend wie bedeutsam. In politisch aufgeladenen Zeiten wie den heutigen besteht die Herausforderung darin, aus musikpädagogischen Spezialisierungen und Projekten heraus allgemeine Perspektiven für den Musikunterricht in der Sekundarstufe 1 zu entwickeln und nebeneinander existierende, oftmals zunächst abstrakt erscheinende Ideen miteinander zu verknüpfen. Der vorliegende Sammelband greift diese zentrale Fragestellung auf und eröffnet wichtige Themenfelder sowie neue Impulse. Dabei enthält der Sammelband zum einen Beiträge, die sich allgemein mit dem Musikunterricht in der Sekundarstufe 1 befassen und Perspektiven zur Persönlichkeitsentwicklung sowie zur Stellung des Musikunterrichts aufzeigen. Zum anderen umfasst der Sammelband Beiträge, die spezifischere Inhalte im Kontext Populärer Musik und (Post-)Digitalität sowie Themen wie Klassenmusizieren, Tanz und Szene oder Musizieren mit allen Sinnen behandeln. Schließlich endet der Sammelband bewusst mit Beiträgen, die eine interdisziplinäre Perspektive einnehmen oder interkulturelle Ansätze und Fragen der Teilhabe thematisieren.

	abstract = {Objectives: In Norway, the potential to increase the number of patients connected to an automated external defibrillator (AED) before ambulance arrival in out-of-hospital cardiac arrests is substantial. A blended learning approach is effective for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training with AED usage, and regular hands-on CPR refresher training is recommended. The objective was to test if provision of CPR-training equipment and learning resources combined with a contract to recruit volunteer CPR trainers could facilitate regular refresher CPR-training in Norwegian football clubs and to increase the number and accessibility of AEDs by providing clubs with AEDs and heated cabinets and mandate registration in the national AED registry.
Methods: Non-randomized pilot study (2020-2023). Clubs signed contracts that they would perform CPR training with the use of AEDs for 70\% of football players/coaches/staff/volunteers each year and place their received AED outdoors in heated cabinets and register their AED in the Norwegian national AED registry. We explored barriers through follow-up e-mails.
Results: We recruited 116 of 278 (42\%) eligible football clubs. From 2020-2023, 5440 football players and 987 coaches/staff/volunteers from 60 (52\%) clubs completed CPR training sessions and 20 (17\%) repeated CPR training. We provided 112 AEDs and 116 heated cabinets. By a deadline, 68/116 (59\%) of clubs had placed their AED outdoors in the heated cabinet and registered their AED correctly in the national AED registry, 27/116 (23\%) placed their AED outdoors but did not complete their registration in the AED registry correctly, 13/116 (11\%) kept their AED locked indoors and 8/116 (7\%) failed to register their AED. Few clubs (20/116, 17\%) provided insights into barriers.
Conclusion: We recruited a satisfactory number of football clubs. Over 6000 players, coaches/staff/volunteers completing CRP training shows promise. Most clubs complied to the message of 24/7/365 availability of AEDs and found registration in the national AED registry uncomplicated.},

	abstract = {Background: Accurate decision-making in triage largely determines the amount of time required for a patient to be evaluated and treated while in the emergency department. Nursing staff worldwide have similar learning characteristics with similar working hours and common goals, despite the fact that different triage scales are used globally. The aim of this mini review is to present the different educational methods and identify the most effective for triage training of triage nurses. Materials and Methods: We screened studies concerning triage education for nurses in Emergency Department, in databases including PubMed, CENTRAL and CINAHL. From November 12, 2023 to February 15, 2024, databases were searched for relevant literature. “Triage education” OR “triage training” AND “emergency nurses” OR “triage nurses” were the MeSH terms.
Results: There are various educational methods, including traditional, web-based, audiovisual, simulation-based, blended learning, and other specialized approaches. Almost all of the studies that are currently available demonstrate how effectively an educational intervention might improve nurses’ comprehension of triage. Except for one, every study concluded that the educational intervention significantly improved nurses’ triage knowledge. Comparing the included studies is challenging due to their heterogeneity, and applying the results in practice requires caution.
Conclusion: The majority of studies reported that educational interventions effectively increased nurses’ triage knowledge. Blended learning in conjunction with refresher courses enhanced triage-related knowledge and decision-making; however, additional research is required to ascertain whether this approach is superior to the others and whether these improvements will last.},

Furthermore, there appears to be a widely held assumption that the use of educational technology will result in improved outcomes. However, there has been limited scrutiny of evidence about the extent to which use of educational technologies impacts teaching and learning outcomes in school contexts. To address these gaps in understanding of educational technologies, this literature review examines the design of technologies, exploring how they have been leveraged to improve various student learning processes and pedagogical practices. Additionally, the review synthesises key findings from existing research on evidence about the impact of technology use in schools. These insights can guide future decisions around the adoption and evaluation of technologies in schools that ensure alignment with pedagogical goals and lead to improvements in student learning.},

These skills are especially crucial for undergraduate and postgraduate students to navigate the challenges associated with academic learning, well-being, and future job performance. However, little attention has been given to exploring how socio-emotional skills can be facilitated in higher education. Across different educational systems and especially in the Chinese context, there seems to be more focus on academic performance and less on socio-emotional learning. Using self-determination theory as the theoretical framework, two studies were designed to investigate the extent to which teachers’ support for autonomy, competence, and relatedness was associated with university students’ socio-emotional skills. Data were collected from 1539 undergraduate students (Study 1) and 499 postgraduate students (Study 2). The results from the two studies indicated that students whose teachers supported their basic needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness had higher levels of socio-emotional skills, including self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship skills, and responsible decisionmaking. This study helps advance our understanding of the role of teachers in students’ socio-emotional skills in both undergraduate and postgraduate contexts.},

Domain-independent natural language processing (NLP) methods, such as generative models, can utilize learner errors and fallacies in argumentation learning to help students write better argumentative texts. To test this, we collect design requirements, and then design and implement two different versions of our system called ALure to improve the students’ argumentation skills. We test how ALure helps students learn argumentation in a university lecture with 305 students and compare the learning gains of the two versions of ALure with a control group using video tutoring. We find and discuss the differences of learning gains in argument structure and fallacies in both groups after using ALure, as well as the control group. Our results shed light on the applicability of computer-supported systems using recent advances in NLP to help students in learning argumentation as a necessary skill for collaborative working settings.

	abstract = {Learners’ attempts to regulate their own motivation for studying in the face of tedious or difficult tasks is an important aspect of self-regulated learning. Therefore, motivation regulation has received increasing attention over the past few years, resulting in numerous publications using different definitions of the construct, samples, operationalizations, and research designs. The aim of this systematic review is to present an interactive evidence and gap map synthesizing current research with respect to what we know about motivation regulation, what the sources (e.g., samples, research methods, operationalizations) of this knowledge are, and which aspects proposed by theoretical models of motivation regulation remain understudied. Based on a systematic literature search, N = 289 studies were included. Approximately three quarters of the studies examined motivation regulation of university students, used cross-sectional study designs, and self-report questionnaires. Achievement, effort-related variables, (meta-)cognitive learning strategies, and goal orientations were the most frequently reported correlates of motivation regulation. Motivation regulation was examined mainly for learning in general, but also in more specific contexts, such as digital or foreign language learning. The maps’ gaps reveal that we still know little about motivation regulation in pre- and primary school children and its development across school years. Furthermore, despite the conceptualization of self-regulation as a context dependent construct, contextual characteristics have received little attention. These and other gaps are discussed, including suggestions for advancing theoretical models of motivation regulation. The structured maps enable quick overviews of evidence (gaps), aiding a rapid, strategic development of future research questions and potential meta-analyses.},

According to the results of the study, we found positive and statistically significant differences in the self-efficacy beliefs and attitudes of student teachers from various disciplines who participated in the seminar. During the practical activities, we observed student teachers’ prejudices and concerns about programming. This process was accompanied by their lack of prior knowledge and prejudices about the open source programming.

Increasing penetration of ICT into education and the disruptive educational technologies are making it possible not only to innovate but also to implement more and more exemplar teaching-learning pedagogies and assessment tools. Such innovations will shift the teaching-learning process from a rote learning process to an inclusive and individualized/personalized process. When developed properly, digital games can assess both procedural knowledge and declarative knowledge of the learners. One such technique of using digital games for assessment is stealth assessment (SA). They help in helps in assessing higher order thinking skills of students accurately and efficiently. SA adopts the approach of competency-based learning, where on the basis of performance of learners in the game their competencies are easily identified and are provided further tasks accordingly. The paper also discusses the challenges in development and implementation of SAs.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated digitization, access to IT resources, and digital inclusion in the Italian school system. This paper presents D-UDA (i.e., “unità didattica di apprendimento digitale”, in Italian), a digital didactic unit for learning mathematics concepts. The presented approach combines teaching methodologies and game-based activities (e.g., the escape room) with a multisensory approach to designing and developing digital and multimodal technologies. D-UDA is divided into two parts: the first part consists of logic puzzles that adhere to the guidelines set by INVALSI (the Italian Istituto Nazionale per la Valutazione del Sistema educativo di Istruzione e di formazione) for mathematics learning, while the second part involves a series of multisensory games designed to promote the development of transversal competencies, such as cooperation and engagement. Moreover, D-UDA encourages children to create their own adventure using the same tools employed by the designers to develop the experience. The children who participated in testing D-UDA in June 2020 were asked to complete usability questionnaires after the experience. Preliminary results indicate the effectiveness of the educational intervention presented, which integrates recent pedagogical theories and teaching methodologies with a multisensory perspective and a technological design.},

Despite its growing importance, there is a notable lack of research on metaverse literacy, especially in education and training. This study aims to conceptualize “metaverse literacy for education” by defining its core components and proposing a framework for its evaluation. Furthermore, we report a case study leveraging an experiential learning approach to explore how exposure to various digital platforms - Virtual Reality (VR) headsets, mobile phones, and personal computers (PC) - influences metaverse literacy and perceptions regarding its adoption. The case study engaged first-year bachelor-level students (N = 30) enrolled in an undergraduate program. Our findings reveal that learning experience with the metaverse significantly shifts students’ perceptions about the effort needed for adoption and enhances their metaverse literacy for education. By focusing on these dimensions, this study makes a contribution to the understanding of metaverse literacy for education, advocating for an experiential approach to learning and adaptation in digital environments.},

	abstract = {Computer-assisted instruction (CAI) is a valuable approach for managing classroom heterogeneity by providing feedback tailored to students’ individual needs. While previous research has primarily focused on the cognitive mechanisms underlying CAI’s effectiveness, it has often overlooked the social-cognitive processes that may contribute to its success by offering students a private learning space away from the judgement of their peers. The present study compared CAI to conventional classroom instruction over a two-week period with 389 tenth-grade history-geography students. First, we expected that CAI would result in better academic learning compared to conventional classroom instruction. Second, we tested alternative hypotheses, that learning gains in CAI would vary depending on students’ levels of academic self-concept (social-cognitive hypothesis) and prior knowledge (cognitive scaffolding hypothesis). Consistent with the social-cognitive hypothesis, multilevel modeling revealed that students with initially lower levels of ASC experienced higher learning gains in CAI compared to conventional classroom instruction, while no benefits were observed for students with lower prior knowledge. Additionally, our results indicate a disruption of the predictive relationship between ASC and subsequent academic performance in the CAI group, compared to the presence of this association in the conventional classroom instruction group. These findings suggest that CAI benefits low-confidence students regardless of their initial ability level and that this method offers a protective effect against the impact of perceived incompetence on subsequent performance.},

Using learning analytics, we examine the inﬂuences of these modalities on collaboration and derive recommendations for their optimized use in the design of future CSCL environments. Our ﬁndings reveal a signiﬁcant impact of communication modalities on the sense of social presence and regulation of collaborative activities. Audio communication results in enhanced co-presence, psychobehavioral accessibility, and better regulation processes compared to video and text modalities, indicating that audio is the most suitable modality in collaborative virtual environments for decision-making tasks. Conversely, video communication still facilitated strategic planning and enhanced self-regulation. Chat communication showed the lowest sense of social presence, yet improvements over time suggest that participants adapt to this modality, enhancing their collaborative efﬁciency.},

	abstract = {The ongoing digitalization presents challenges for schools, particularly in the use of digital media in instructional teaching and learning processes with the goal of supporting the acquisition of both subject-speciﬁc and cross-disciplinary competencies for all students. However, considering digital competencies, it has been shown that these are also subject to social disparities. Nevertheless, ICILS identiﬁes organizationally resilient schools, where students achieve above-average digital competencies despite challenging student compositions. Studies examining subject-speciﬁc competencies indicate that organizationally resilient schools share common characteristics. One signiﬁcant characteristic in this context is the design of teaching quality features. Digital competencies, however, remain under-researched in this regard. Therefore, the present study investigates the fundamental dimensions of teaching quality at resilient schools in the context of the acquisition of digital competencies using data from the BMBF-funded qualitative ICILS in-depth study ‘UneSICILS 2018’ (Unexpectedly Successful Schools in the Digital Transformation). For the analysis, 22 guided interviews with teachers and seven group interviews with students were content-analyzed concerning efﬁcient classroom management, cognitive activation, and constructive support. The analysis of the dimension of ‘efﬁcient classroom management’ reveals that organization and structure through digital media, such as the use of digital learning platforms, are signiﬁcant factors. In terms of cognitive activation, the use of digital tools to connect individual prior knowledge is highlighted as important. Additionally, the dimension of ‘constructive support’ indicates the promotion of self-directed learning and the development of support structures for (cooperative) learning with digital media as signiﬁcant. Inductively, the dimension of ‘content selection and selective focusing’ was added, underscoring the high relevance of acquiring digital competencies in teaching at resilient schools.},

(GIO)’ presents a novel video learning format for optimizing virtual meetings as well as initial evaluation data on its usefulness and application in an organizational context: the MeetingHacks. Effective collaboration in virtual meetings requires a novel approach to fusing communication and technology. To enhance virtual meetings through accessible digital interventions, we developed MeetingHacks, a series of short videos based on ﬁndings of contemporary meeting science. These MeetingHacks address general aspects as well as professional, methodological, social, and proactive aspects of meeting behavior, aligning with the four facets of team skills of the Kassler competence grid. The introductory video, Meetings General, triggers reﬂective processes to enhance the impact of the subsequent MeetingHacks. Meetings Professional focuses on professional skills, particularly the interplay of problems and solutions and knowledge transfer, drawing on results from interaction analysis and shared mental models. Meetings Structured addresses methodological behavior, emphasizing structured meeting designs. Meetings Social covers prosocial behavior, focusing on making social and informal interaction in virtual meetings more tangible. Meetings Proactive highlights responsibility and proactivity in meetings, informed by interaction analysis and reﬂection research. The MeetingHacks were implemented over ﬁve weeks in a corporate setting and evaluated for their usefulness, applicability, and ﬁt within daily routines. The results demonstrated the beneﬁts and limits of MeetingHacks in an organizational context. Based on this evaluation, this article critically discusses the merits and further development of the MeetingHacks and their effectiveness as a digital intervention.},

	abstract = {In vocational education and training, it can be assumed that the digital transformation increases the relevance of individuals’ cross-occupational collaboration competency (COCC) across vocational and professional sectors, thus improving and reorganizing processes across time and domains on the basis of available information. This poses a challenge to instruction and diagnostics in VET, which can be supported by thorough, empirically grounded theoretical modeling. In Striković and Wittmann (2022), we suggested a role-theoretical approach to modeling COCC involving five role-theoretical dimensions: knowing one’s own occupational role, knowing the occupational role of one’s collaboration partners, latent processes of role distance, role-taking, and object-oriented role coordination. In the present study, we evaluate this role-theoretical model empirically using the example of nursing, specifying and operationalizing the model with a computer-based situational judgment test and using a data set of 328 nursing students to carry out an in-depth analysis of (1) dimensionality and (2) role-related task features thought to influence item difficulty. While model comparisons showed the superiority of a unidimensional vector compared to five- and two-dimensional structures, linear additive regression analysis revealed that the role-related task features on the basis of the five dimensions showed significant effects, as did the number of collaboration partners and the test subjects’ subject-matter competence, which can also be linked to the nurses’ situational role. These findings are in line with our theoretical reasoning in the COCC model. We discuss their limitations as well as their theoretical and educational significance, outlining needs for further research—also in other professional and vocational domains.},

However, more empirical studies are needed to facilitate its wider application in school curricula. A significant challenge is designing and implementing valid in-game assessments crucial for measuring student progress and providing reliable references for instructors’ intervention decisions. Stealth assessment, guided by the evidence-centred design (ECD) framework, offers a promising solution but requires more specific guidelines for full effectiveness. In this study, we present a granular, framework-supported pipeline to systematically implement stealth assessments in a GBL environment. This pipeline involves constructing an ECD framework, generating features, selecting appropriate models, preprocessing data, evaluating model performance, and conducting model inference on a black-box computational model. We validate the effectiveness of this pipeline by assessing the performance of these computational models and identifying distinct behavioural patterns between high and low performers. Our analysis highlights potential areas for improvement in the design of stealth assessments within digital games for learning. Furthermore, we discuss the generalizability of the proposed pipeline and outline limitations for future research to address.},

First, a systematic review reveals the different features of prompts used across various studies. Second, a quantitative meta-analysis using a random-effects model shows that digital prompts significantly enhance learning achievement (d = .394), though adjustment for publication bias yielded a more conservative estimate (d = .220). Their effectiveness is largely moderated by prompt design features. Based on meta-regression models, we find the highest efficacy for action-based prompts (rule-based AI) (d = .465), prompts designed for specific learner groups (d = .513), and combinations of generic and directed prompts (d = .571). Regional differences were pronounced, with studies from East Asia showing substantially larger effects than European settings. The effectiveness of learning prompts is further moderated by the learning domain and target group. Our findings reveal that prompts are not a universal solution but require thoughtful implementation. We recommend implementing action-based prompts triggered by learner behavior, using log data to tailor prompts to expertise levels. Designers should keep prompts concise to minimize cognitive load. We advise combining generic and directed prompts based on learning goals. Finally, it is essential to ensure learners are familiar with prompt use. These evidence-based guidelines can help optimize digital learning prompts to support diverse learner needs.},

	abstract = {The complex processes of collaborative knowledge construction require a multimodal approach to capture the interplay between learners, tools, and the environment. While existing studies have recognized the importance of considering multiple modalities, there remains a need for a comprehensive framework that explicitly models the dynamics of knowledge representation and construction. Drawing on theoretical perspectives from collaborative knowledge-building, distributed cognition, and multiple representations in science education, we propose a multimodal representation framework that captures the diverse ways in which learners externalize, negotiate, and advance their understanding. We employ Transmodal Ordered Network Analysis to examine the interplay between knowledge representations across three distinct yet interconnected spaces: the virtual space of the digital environment, the conceptual space of internal knowledge, and the physical space of gestures. This approach enables a more granular and accurate modeling of the temporal dynamics and influences associated with different modalities. Investigating 16 groups of college students (n = 77) who utilized an immersive astronomy simulation in their introductory astronomy course, results reveal distinct patterns between high- and low-learning groups. Notably, high-learning groups demonstrated more frequent and stronger crossmodal connections, linking verbal explanations with digital representations within the simulation and with embodied representations through gestures. It extends the theory of multiple representations by demonstrating its importance not only for individual learning but also for collaborative processes. The findings highlight the need for designing learning environments and analytic approaches that can support and capture the rich multimodal interactions through which students co-construct scientific understanding.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) holds significant potential for enhancing student learning. This reflection critically examines the promises and limitations of AI for cognitive learning processes and outcomes, drawing on empirical evidence and theoretical insights from research on AI-enhanced education and digital learning technologies. We critically discuss current publication trends in research on AI-enhanced learning and rather than assuming inherent benefits, we emphasize the role of instructional implementation and the need for systematic investigations that build on insights from existing research on the role of technology in instructional effectiveness. Building on this foundation, we introduce the ISAR model, which differentiates four types of AI effects on learning compared to learning conditions without AI, namely inversion, substitution, augmentation, and redefinition. Specifically, AI can substitute existing instructional approaches while maintaining equivalent instructional functionality, augment instruction by providing additional cognitive learning support, or redefine tasks to foster deep learning processes. However, the implementation of AI must avoid potential inversion effects, such as over-reliance leading to reduced cognitive engagement. Additionally, successful AI integration depends on moderating factors, including students’ AI literacy and educators’ technological and pedagogical skills. Our discussion underscores the need for a systematic and evidence-based approach to AI in education, advocating for rigorous research and informed adoption to maximize its potential while mitigating possible risks.},

Peer feedback systems often support student reviewers through instructor-generated comment prompts that include various scaffolding features. However, there is little research in the context of higher education on which features tend to be used in practice nor to which extent typical uses impact comment length and comment helpfulness. This study explored the relative frequencies of twelve specific features (divided into metacognitive, motivational, strategic, and conceptual scaffolds) that could be included as scaffolding comment prompts and their relationship to comment length and helpfulness. A large dataset from one online peer review system was used, which involved naturalistic course data from 281 courses at 61 institutions. The degree of presence of each feature was coded in the N = 2883 comment prompts in these courses. Since a given comment prompt often contained multiple features, statistical models were used to tease apart the unique relationship of each comment prompt feature with comment length and helpfulness. The metacognitive scaffolds of prompts for elaboration and setting expectations, and the motivational scaffolds of binary questions were positively associated with mean comment length. The strategic scaffolds of requests for strength identification and example were positively associated with mean comment helpfulness. Only the conceptual scaffold of subdimension descriptions were positively associated with both. Interestingly, instructors rarely included the most useful features in comment prompts. The effects of comment prompt features were larger for comment length than comment helpfulness. Practical implications for designing more effective comment prompts are discussed.},

Based on 17 indepth interviews, an Action-Decision Framework of new model is established. Subsequently, a examination of 150 questionnaires through fsQCA uncovers diverse configurations of learners’ adoption intention of Influencer-led Education. The outcomes of the fsQCA disclose five configurations associated with high adoption intention and two configurations leading to low intention, highlighting heterogeneous representations among distinct learner cohorts within the decision framework. This research contributes to the expansion and deepening of theories pertaining to learners’ engagement with Influencer-led Education, while providing insights into the intricate mechanisms driving learning behaviors in the realm of novel learning scenarios.},

	abstract = {The goal of the present study was to assess biology students’ level of understanding and identify their misconceptions about cellular concepts. We conducted a questionnaire survey followed by interviews. Study participants (n = 620) were students enrolled in a biology degree programme. Data analysis showed that students had low knowledge of the basic characteristics of cells. Misconceptions were identified in all four core competencies of cell biology education. The most identified common misconceptions concerned the relationship between the structure and function of the cell membrane, nucleus and endoplasmic reticulum. Students have difficulty making the connection between cellular transport and its relationship to the structure of the plasma membrane. Students also struggled to make the connection between the different levels of organisation (macroscopic, microscopic and molecular). However, most students understood the concepts related to the chemical constituents of cells. Several potential factors are responsible for the appearance of misconceptions among the participants in this study, including levels, failure to use learning resources to visualise the various phenomena that take place in the cell, incomprehensible terms, and complexity of the processes and mechanisms of cell biology which, to understand them, require recourse to concepts taught in other disciplines such as physics and chemistry.},

	abstract = {Role recognition is critical for labor division and risk identification in group coordination during collaborative learning. Students’ social, cognitive, behavioural, and emotional performance during collaboration are essential dimensions for role recognition. However, most studies classify roles using single dimensions, such as cognitive (knowledge construction level) or social (social network status), neglecting behavioral and emotional indicators. This study develops a multidimensional role recognition model integrating social, cognitive, behavioural, and emotional features to automatically detect students’ roles (coordinator, inquirer, assistant, marginal) during collaboration. Results show that the multidimensional model outperforms singledimensional models, with ensemble classifiers (e.g., random forest, XGBoost) outperforming single classifiers (e.g., support vector machine, decision tree). Additionally, an interpretable framework is proposed for global and local explanations of the model. Globally, social, cognitive, emotional, and behavioural factors influence role recognition, with eight key features identified for each role. Common features, such as investment and overall responsivity, influence all roles, while others vary in their impact. Locally, the framework supports personalized interventions, such as tailored collaborative scripts. These findings offer valuable insights for researchers and practitioners, enabling early identification of roles associated with academic risks and the design of targeted instructional strategies.},

This study presents a systematic review of research on the utilization of virtual simulation technology in science education over the past decade. In this review, 73 articles were screened from three major databases using string and manual screening protocols. This literature review, emphasizes the analysis of virtual simulation-based science education from two aspects including pedagogy (instructional environment, instructional activity design, and technology design) and instructional outcomes. The findings reveal important factors such as trends in the application science education pedagogy, pedagogical effectiveness, types of equipment, and research methodology, as well as whether or not teacher training is required for the use of virtual simulation. Finally, the practical implications of virtual reality-based teaching and directions of future research are discussed.},

	abstract = {Background: Social context and peers significantly impact students' motivation, especially in collaborative learning settings. However, there is limited evidence on how students strategically influence each other's motivation through socially shared regulation of learning (SSRL). Aims: This study examined secondary school students' SSRL during collaborative learning, focusing on how groups regulate motivation and how these regulation processes influence individual situational motivation through peer interactions. Sample: The participants were 95 secondary school students (13–16 years) performing a collaborative science task in 31 groups.
Methods: Collaborative learning was videotaped to capture motivation regulation from social interactions. Four times during the task, individual perceptions of peer influence on motivation and motivation regulation were collected with situational self-reports, and individual stimulated-recall interviews were conducted after the task.
Results: The results showed that motivation regulation is embedded within broader SSRL processes. When motivation regulation coincided more likely with cognitive regulation, students perceived significantly higher peer influence on motivation. In interviews, students highlighted cognitive and social aspects of SSRL as crucial for their situational motivation but did not hardly recognize any direct motivation regulation strategies.
Conclusions: This study contributes to the methodological advancements for studying motivation as situation- and context-specific,emphasizingtheuseofdifferentdatachannels to capture the dynamic interplay between the individual- and group-level aspects throughout the learning process. For},

	abstract = {Online learning has significantly transformed education, especially by providing greater flexibility for both students and teachers in learning processes. However, online classes tend to rely more on teacher-centered presentations, allowing them to isolate students from the learning process. The diverse characteristics of students are a challenge for teachers in building interaction and communication and facilitating effective collaboration. A literature review shows that interaction is important for student learning outcomes. Therefore, understanding and categorizing student characteristics is important in building a learning community so that it can improve teacher and student interaction, as outlined in cybergogy-based online learning models. Cybergogy is a new concept of cyber-based learning with three main domains: cognitive, emotional, and social, known as engaged learning. This approach emphasizes the importance of creating a holistic and engaging online learning environment that caters to the diverse needs of learners. The research findings indicate that online learning designed based on cybergogy principles effectively fosters student engagement and collaboration, thereby successfully mitigating key issues that often hinder the effectiveness of online education. By recognizing and addressing the cognitive, emotional, and social aspects of learning, cybergogy aims to foster a sense of community, encourage active participation, and promote deeper understanding.},

	abstract = {We propose an online learning framework for forecasting nonlinear spatio-temporal signals (ﬁelds). The method integrates (i) dimensionality reduction, here, a simple proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) projection; (ii) a generalized autoregressive model to forecast reduced dynamics, here, a reservoir computer; (iii) online adaptation to update the reservoir computer (the model), here, ensemble sequential data assimilation. We demonstrate the framework on a wake past a cylinder governed by the Navier-Stokes equations, exploring the assimilation of full ﬂow ﬁelds (projected onto POD modes) and sparse sensors. Three scenarios are examined: a naïve physical state estimation; a two-fold estimation of physical and reservoir states; and a three-fold estimation that also adjusts the model parameters. The two-fold strategy signiﬁcantly improves ensemble convergence and reduces reconstruction error compared to the naïve approach. The three-fold approach enables robust online training of partially-trained reservoir computers, overcoming limitations of a priori training. By unifying data-driven reduced order modelling with Bayesian data assimilation, this work opens new opportunities for scalable online model learning for nonlinear time series forecasting.},

	abstract = {When computations of the dynamic behavior of a digital twin includes the recursion of an internal state, data assimilation can be used to adjust the numerical values of the state. The optimal linear adjustment of this state on the basis of observations and simulations is known as a Kalman ﬁlter, in which an optimal linear gain is computed based on covariance information to minimize the variance on the state error. This paper illustrates that such covariance information can be learned and used to ﬁnd an optimal trade-oﬀ between the observations and simulations for state adjustment. Although the concept of learning covariance information is well understood by the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF), this paper emphasizes the underlying approach how to learn covariance information with the purpose of convergence and minimal variance of the state error. The concept is illustrated for a dynamic digital twins of a linear oscillatory mechanical system and a non-linear dynamic wildﬁre progression. The examples illustrate that the results on data assimilation heavily depends on the quality of the covariance information.},

	abstract = {Given the many opportunities for technology use in education nowadays (e.g., Large language models, explainer videos, digital quizzing), teachers should know and rely on evidence-based answers to questions about when, how, and why technology-augmented instruction helps or hinders learning. To date, finding these answers requires integrating theories and concepts from multiple research fields (e.g., multimedia learning, intelligent tutoring systems, gamification) and perspectives on learning (cognition, motivation), which makes evidence-based answers less likely to be found in practice. To address this problem, we drafted a simple model (i.e., FoRe-Squares model) that synthesizes evidence-based concepts from various research fields and both cognitive and motivational theory. The FoRe-Squares model predicts that technology-augmented instruction is effective only when it provides both Focus support (cognitive factor) and Reward (motivational factor) to enable and motivate active goal-directed processing. Technology-augmented instruction is thus more effective when it does not just apply cognitive techniques (e.g., signaling, contiguity) to increase focus support, but also motivational techniques (e.g., choice, gamification) to increase reward. Furthermore, cognitive-motivational techniques (e.g., elaborative feedback, intrinsic integration) are most likely effective for learning because they increase both focus support and reward at the same time; they should be prioritized when only a few techniques can be applied. Since just the two factors of focus support and reward predict learning outcomes across a broad range of situations, the FoRe-Squares model aims to provide a simple but evidence-based guide to technology-augmented instruction that should help instructional practice and inspire further research including instruction without technology.},

Cases were selected from a virtual makerspace offered in the summer of 2023 to illustrate the entanglement of technology and pedagogy. We then discuss in detail the technological and pedagogical considerations associated with these dimensions.

	abstract = {The rise of digital technology has significantly reshaped educational practices, making self-regulated learning (SRL) critical for success in computer-supported collaborative learning environments. This study employed latent profile analysis to explore whether students with different motivation profiles exhibit variations in SRL. Drawing on achievement goal theory and expectancy-value theory, the analysis focused on five motivational variables: mastery approach, performance approach, work avoidance, expectancy belief, and value belief. The study took place with 539 Chinese college students (56.8\% women) to identify homogeneous latent motivation profiles. Four distinct profiles were identified: (1) Amotivated, (2) Goal-driven but doubtful, (3) Valueoriented/Goal-reserved, and (4) Comprehensively motivated. Furthermore, BCH analysis revealed significant variations in SRL behaviors across profiles. Students in the Comprehensively motivated group displayed the strongest SRL behaviors across all dimensions, while those in the Amotivated group exhibited the weakest performance. Students in the Goal-driven but doubtful and Value-oriented/Goal-reserved groups demonstrated overall average SRL abilities but minor differences in specific SRL behaviors. These results provide a nuanced understanding of how motivation profiles influence student behaviors and outcomes in CSCL environments. Insights from the study may help educators tailor their instructional practices and support strategies to enhance student engagement and learning efficacy.},

	abstract = {Background BOPPPS (Bridge-in, Objective, Preassessment, Participatory learning, Post-assessment, Summary) has emerged as a compelling alternative in clinical and health education, particularly in medical and nursing education. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of BOPPPS in clinical and health education, with a primary focus on medical education, while also considering its applications in related disciplines such as nursing and health services management.
Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted using databases of PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science, covering studies up to May 15th, 2023. Inclusion criteria were studies involving undergraduate students in clinical and health disciplines (e.g., medicine, nursing, health services management) using BOPPPS, comparing it to traditional teaching methods, and reporting on relevant outcomes. Exclusion criteria were studies not focused on clinical and health education or without a comparison group. Quality assessment was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for non-randomized studies and the Jadad scale for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Heterogeneity among the studies was evaluated using the I² statistic and Cochran’s Q test. Publication bias was assessed using funnel plots and Egger’s test.
Results A total of 146 publications were initially retrieved, with 16 studies (1198 in the BOPPPS group and 1122 in the control group) included. The pooled result revealed that BOPPPS significantly improved final examination scores (Standardized mean difference: 1.14, 95\% CI 0.84–1.43; P {\textless} 0.001) compared to traditional teaching. Egger’s test indicated no significant publication bias (p-value = 0.12). Additional benefits included improved student satisfaction (SMD 0.94, 95\% CI 0.63–1.26; P {\textless} 0.001), classroom interaction (SMD 0.83, 95\% CI 0.46–1.21; P {\textless} 0.001), and learning initiative (SMD 0.73, 95\% CI 0.48–0.98; P {\textless} 0.001).
Conclusion BOPPPS demonstrates significant potential for enhancing various dimensions of clinical and health education, including academic performance, student engagement, and satisfaction. Policymakers and educational leaders should consider integrating BOPPPS into teacher training and curriculum design to promote active learning and improve learning outcomes. However, further research is necessary to explore its effectiveness in diverse cultural and educational contexts, as well as its potential impact on developing higher-order cognitive skills like critical The efficacy of the BOPPPS teaching model},

We posit that this claim has not been critically examined from a relational and material sociological perspective. In this conceptual paper we therefore mobilise a relational and material sociology to query the relational potentials of large language models (LLMs) as compared to more traditional education tools. We conclude that the appeal of LLM tools like ChatGPT resides in their seemingly endless mutability, i.e. the tools appear to change to respond to their users’needs. The relational challenge is to ensure that this apparent movement on the part of the tool does not lead to stasis on the part of the learner. Our discussion brings to the fore the often forgotten cognitive and pedagogical functions of seemingly‘dumb’and static learning tools.},

This study introduced individual preparation (IP) as a pedagogical design and examined its role in students’ collaborative learning outcomes and processes. Eighty-two engineering students from a Singapore university worked in pairs and completed two tasks under two conditions: With-IP and Without-IP. Students’ design artefacts and collaborative learning outcomes were scored, and their verbal discussions were analysed to identify epistemic behaviours during collaboration. The findings indicate that students in the With-IP condition achieved higher collaborative learning scores and demonstrated more elaboration and synthesis, compared to more superficial exchanges in the Without-IP condition. Sequence mining further revealed distinct epistemic behaviour trajectories, with the WithIP condition promoting more in-depth peer interactions over time. This study provides a comprehensive examination of IP’s role in collaborative learning, offering valuable insights for educators designing and implementing IP to support effective collaboration.},

	abstract = {Abstract          In this era of digital heritage, immersive media, such as 360° documentaries, have been proposed to enrich engagement and learning. However, how immersive 360° media formats influence the understanding of ethnic minority cultures remains underexplored. We conducted a controlled laboratory experiment comparing traditional 2D and 360° documentary presentations of the Miao community in Guizhou Province, using the same narration and content, including village scenes, performances, and crafts, to isolate the effect of media format. The results suggest that the 360° documentary may increase viewers’ enjoyment, sense of presence, curiosity, and appreciation of cultural content relative to a comparable 2D film. These exploratory findings indicate a potential for immersive media to deepen cultural understanding. Our study underscores 360° documentaries as a promising tool for engaging audiences with ethnic minority cultures, while noting that these conclusions are provisional given the lab setting and should be tested in real-world museum contexts.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Simulation-based training (SBT) is an integral and indispensable component of medical and healthcare education, especially pertinent in acute care. Conventional forms of SBT in acute care primarily involve manikins or task trainers, which are either costly or too task-specific. Recent innovations in virtual patient simulation software (VPS) invites the opportunity for conjoined use with basic manikins, creating a hybrid model for acute-care teaching. This study aimed to: ① Assess the impact of hybrid simulation teaching on the collective efficacy (CE) and self-efficacy (SE) of medical students, and ② evaluate psychometric measurement scales within the simulation context.
Methods: A prospective cross-sectional cohort study was conducted between 22 September 2023, and 19 December 2023. Fifth year medical students in an undergraduate medicine program underwent hybrid SBT, incorporating VPS and basic manikin within two separate clinical scenarios. Primary outcome of CE and SE was measured using adapted versions of the Perceived Collective Efficacy (PCE) scale and Motivational Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ). Both scales were distributed to students before and after undergoing hybrid SBT.
Results: Data from 94 students were available for pairwise testing. Significant improvements were observed in the CE and SE of students after undergoing hybrid SBT [CE: (12.16 ± 3.86 vs 15.42 ± 2.87); p {\textless} 0.001]; [SE: 24(23–32) vs 32(28–34); p {\textless} 0.001]. Scale evaluation of Perceived Collective Efficacy (PCE) and Motivational Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ) revealed good scale Cronbach α scores [PCE: pretest α = 0.929; posttest α = 0.914]; [MSLQ: pretest α = 0.971.; posttest α = 0.968].
Conclusion: Hybrid SBT facilitated by virtual patient simulator and basic manikin provides a moderate-cost and adaptable approach which positively impacted the CE and SE of medical students. As software development readily adapts in providing point-of-care learner feedback, hybrid SBT should become more widely implemented to fully harness its potential.},

	abstract = {Background In educational practice, the interaction between students’ learning behaviors and psychological states is crucial. Learning engagement reflects the degree of active participation in learning activities, academic self-efficacy embodies students’ confidence in their own learning abilities, and learning anxiety may affect students’ academic performance and mental health. Purpose This study aims to break through traditional linear thinking by using Latent Profile Analysis to identify heterogeneous groups of high school students in terms of learning engagement, reveal differences in their learning anxiety and nonlinear characteristics, and validate the differentiated mediating mechanism of academic self-efficacy between learning engagement and anxiety. It fills the theoretical gap from the perspective of group heterogeneity and provides a basis and support for constructing a learning psychological theory model and precise stratified intervention in educational practice. Methods In this study, the method of cluster convenience sampling was adopted. Three ordinary high schools in a city of Hubei Province were selected, and students from six classes in each grade from the first year to the third year of senior high school were sampled as the research subjects. A total of 1,008 original questionnaires were obtained, and 936 valid questionnaires were collected. LPA was employed to identify the potential categories of high school students’ learning engagement and the impact of these categories on learning anxiety. Additionally, the mediating role of academic self-efficacy between different types of learning engagement and learning anxiety was examined based on the classification results. Furthermore, a generalized additive mixed model was used to analyze the linear relationships between different types of learning engagement, academic self-efficacy, and learning anxiety.},

	abstract = {The regulation of learning and problem solving in individual and social contexts is today considered two key capabilities of the 21st century. In this article, we aim to understand some of the interactions between social metacognitive regulation and collaborative problem solving, in particular, solution generation, in the design of virtual learning environments. The methodological strategy used was discourse analysis, from the perspective of discursive psychology. An online learning environment using a video conferencing system was set up to record verbal interactions of pre-service teachers. Three characteristic social forms of thought or models of discursive interaction were characterized, namely: individual disconnection, individual connection, and group connection. It was concluded that the recognition or not of one’s own and others’ versions of the generation of the solution fosters discursive synergies that strengthen or not the agreement and consensus, as well as relationships of solidarity and trust. In the first model, participants present their own versions and ignore the versions of others, failing to acknowledge the conflict. In the second model, participants present their own versions and acknowledge the versions of others, without managing the conflict. This generates discursive synergies to influence, impose, or position one version over others that are not recognized in the first model, or that are accepted or rejected without acknowledging their interactions in the second model. In the third model, participants recognize their own and others’ versions, thereby recognizing and managing the conflict. This generates discursive synergies that strengthen the agreement and foster specific or general consensus, promoting directed or distributed leadership.},

The study was motivated by the emerging need to evaluate how communication patterns and engagement are affected by instructional modalities in the post-pandemic context. Using a mixed-method approach, including questionnaires and semi-structured interviews with 50 randomly selected students, this research explores interactional dynamics and identifies existing gaps in current literature regarding rural-based blended learning practices. The results indicate that offline learning fosters stronger student–lecturer and peer–peer interaction due to richer nonverbal cues and immediacy of feedback, while online learning shows limited engagement, especially in rural settings. However, some students reported higher comfort and participation in digital settings due to reduced social pressure. The study concludes that a blended learning approach, supported by interactive tools and digital training, may optimize communication and inclusiveness. These findings have practical implications for improving instructional design, especially in under-resourced educational institutions, and highlight the importance of digital infrastructure and pedagogical capacity building in enhancing learning interaction.},

	abstract = {To promote deeper cognitive interactions and positive socio-emotional interactions among group members, thereby achieving high-quality collaborative outcomes, researchers have endeavored to develop conversational agents (CAs) that provide adaptive support to small groups. However, existing CAs for supporting collaborative learning struggled to integrate and analyze multi-source learning data throughout the collaborative learning process and to offer comprehensive and personalized scaffolding based on diagnostic results. To address these issues, this study designed a CA named CollaBot, based on the contingent teaching model, which has been used in the past to guide teachers on how to provide adaptive scaffolding to small groups. CollaBot integrates AI technologies, including retrieval-based models, generative AI models, and retrieval-augmented generation techniques, to offer adaptive cognitive, metacognitive, and social scaffolding to groups engaged in online collaborative learning. A randomized controlled experimental design was employed, recruiting 78 undergraduate students who were randomly divided into two groups: the experimental group (n = 39) utilized a co-writing platform with CollaBot, while the control group (n = 39) used the platform with task scripts. Results indicate that students supported by CollaBot demonstrated significantly better learning performance. In addition, both CollaBot and task scripts significantly enhanced students’ self-efficacy for writing. Furthermore, analysis of the interview data revealed both positive perceptions about CollaBot, such as aiding group members in regulating their own and the group’s learning processes and supporting the development of writing skills, as well as negative perceptions, including causing anxiety and providing ambiguous feedback. This research provides guidance for the design of CAs and offers insights into harnessing hybrid intelligence between teachers and GAI to support collaborative learning.},

	abstract = {The rapid transition to digital education, fueled by the pandemic, has seen a rise in the use of online assessments. However, the process of educators generating these questions has remained largely inefficient and time-consuming. Our work introduces an innovative Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach that empowers educators by automating the creation of True/False assessments, freeing up their time for more advanced instructional tasks. This system, aligned with the Indian Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) curriculum, offers a unique combination of summarization techniques, semi-supervised learning, and a novel question-sampling algorithm. Using deep learning models for summarization and answer identification, this framework also identifies true statements and generates the corresponding false statements through transformer-based models. A specialized sampling algorithm tailors question generation to educators’ needs by assessing sentence difficulty and ranking them accordingly. Validation with high school teachers demonstrates the effectiveness of the framework. Compared to existing systems, our method achieves higher percentages across key metrics in terms of grammar semantics (82.4\% vs. 81\%), answerability (83.6\% vs. 77\%), and relevance (84.7\% vs. 84\%)—as well as stronger inter-annotator agreement with Kappa scores of 0.79 in grammar semantics and 0.76 in answerability. These results indicate that the framework not only saves educators time but also enhances assessment quality, making it a valuable tool for both learners and teachers in educational technology.},

	abstract = {Background With the lockdown imposed by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, remote online teaching (ROT) became pivotal in the rapid reorganization imposed on the healthcare professions’ educational programs. Physiotherapy programs were particularly affected, as they are characterized by hard and soft skills that are hardly learned with ROT. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the experiences and opinions on ROT by faculties involved in the education and training of Physiotherapy students during the pandemic, and on its possible application thereafter.
Methods Following accreditated checklists for qualitative research, semi-structured interviews were conducted by members of the National Directorate of the Physiotherapy programs in Italy. Academic directors (AD) and clinical training coordinators (CTC) of Italian Physiotherapy programs were randomly selected and interviewed, to collect their experiences and opinions on the use of ROT before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Iterative rounds of readings and discussions were conducted to analyze the interviews.
Results A total of 22 participants were interviewed, reaching a satisfactory level of saturation. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, ROT was used sporadically in academic activities; during the pandemic, participants familiarized themselves rapidly with this new approach, which was generally abandoned thereafter. After initial difficulties, most participants recognized the importance of ROT in preserving education during the lockdown. A negative impact on Physiotherapy students was occasionally reported, especially during their final exam and thesis dissertation. Despite the limitations of ROT in Physiotherapy education, participants recognized its advantages in supporting administrative tasks, sharing lectures, and creating international programs. Its potential for pedagogical innovation and the opportunity for investments in Internet-based didactic approaches were also underlined.
Conclusions ROT was perceived as an important tool to preserve Physiotherapy programs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although it was in general discontinued after the pandemic, many participants believed that it might contribute to establishing a “new normal” didactic paradigm in Physiotherapy education.},
