	abstract = {Based on educational-psychological backgrounds on learning through communication and current requirements regarding the development of media skills this article examines the use of online forums in academic teaching from a theoretical and a practical perspective. First, the potential and the specific characteristics of asynchronous and text-based communication in forums are outlined. Then, didactical methods to support frequent participation and transactive communication are introduced. The main focus lays on the role of moderation processes by university teachers or peers as well as on the potentials of using cooperation scripts as instructional guidance for argumentation and exchange processes. Against this background concrete didactic scenarios as well as recommendations on how they might be realized in virtual environments are deduced and illustrated. Subsequently, suggestions are made on how the effectiveness and quality of these approaches can be proved and secured by using the indicators of participation and knowledge and skill acquisition. Finally, practical implications and future research perspectives are discussed.},

	abstract = {Background: E-learning technologies, including mobile apps, are used to a large extent in health care education. Mobile apps can provide extendable learning environments and motivate students for adaptive and collaborative learning outside the classroom context. Developers should design practical, effective, and easy-to-use mobile apps. Usability testing is an important part of app development in order to understand if apps meet the needs of users. Objective: The aim of this study is to perform a scoping review of usability methods and attributes reported in usability studies of mobile apps for health care education. Methods: The scoping review is guided by the methodological framework developed by Arksey \& O?Malley and further developed by Levac et al and Kahlil et al. The stages we will follow are as follows: (1) identifying the research question; (2) identifying relevant studies; (3) selecting studies; (4) charting the data; and (5) summarizing and reporting the results. We have developed two research questions to meet the aim of the study, which are as follows: (1) What usability methods are used to evaluate the usability of mobile apps for health care education? and (2) What usability attributes are reported in the usability studies of mobile apps for health care education? We will apply a comprehensive search of the literature, including 10 databases, a reference search, and a search for grey literature. Two review authors will independently screen articles for eligibility. Results: The initial electronic database searches were completed in March 2019. The literature search identified 14,297 unique references. Following title and abstract screening, the full texts of 369 records were obtained. The scoping review is expected to be completed in spring 2021. Conclusions: We expect the overview of usability methods and attributes reported in usability studies of mobile apps for health care education to contribute to the knowledge base for researchers and developers. It will give an overview of the research field and provide researchers and developers with relevant and important information on the usability research area, including highlighting possible research gaps.

	abstract = {Background: The use of new technology like virtual reality, e-learning, and serious gaming can offer novel, more accessible options that have been demonstrated to improve learning outcomes. Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the educational effectiveness of serious game?based simulation training to traditional mannequin-based simulation training and to determine the perceptions of physicians and nurses. We used an obstetric use case, namely electronic fetal monitoring interpretation and decision making, for our assessment. Methods: This study utilized a mixed methods approach to evaluate the effectiveness of the new, serious game?based training method and assess participants? perceptions of the training. Participants were randomized to traditional simulation training in a center with mannequins or serious game training. They then participated in an obstetrical in-situ simulation scenario to assess their learning. Participants also completed a posttraining perceptions questionnaire. Results: The primary outcome measure for this study was the participants? performance in an in-situ mannequin-based simulation scenario, which occurred posttraining following a washout period. No significant statistical differences were detected between the mannequin-based and serious game?based groups in overall performance, although the study was not sufficiently powered to conclude noninferiority. The survey questions were tested for significant differences in participant perceptions of the educational method, but none were found. Qualitative participant feedback revealed important areas for improvement, with a focus on game realism. Conclusions: The serious game training tool developed has potential utility in providing education to those without access to large simulation centers; however, further validation is needed to demonstrate if this tool is as effective as mannequin-based simulation.},

	abstract = {Effective relationship between education and practice is of great importance for medical graduate students. Obviously, graduates of medical sciences should be familiar with the practical application of theoretical knowledge, clinical actions and encounter with patients. Along this, continuing medical education (CME) programs are introduced and implemented in the field of medical education throughout the world. Continuing medical education includes activities aimed at preserving and developing the knowledge, skills and professional performance of medical team members being in line with providing better services to patients, community or profession. The ultimate goal of continuing medical education programs is to improve the quality of patient care through professional training. However, improving the quality of learner’s education is not possible without the transformation of methods and teaching techniques. The use of innovative educational methods in the process of continuing education in different countries leads to favorable outcomes which can be very effective for other countries. In this research, the common and effective methods of medical education are introduced by reviewing the contexts of medical sciences. These methods include lectures, collaborative patterns, group discussions, problem solving, e-learning, clinical education, evidence-based medicine, and medical-based simulations. According to the aforementioned methods, three methods of clinical education, evidence-based medicine and medical-based simulations are specific to medical science, and the rest of the methods are common with other disciplines.},

	abstract = {Background: Electronic learning (e-learning) in postgraduate medical education has seen a rapid evolution; however, we tend to evaluate it only on its primary outcome or learning aim, whereas its effectiveness also depends on its instructional design. We believe it is important to have an overview of all the methods currently used to evaluate e-learning design so that the preferred method may be identified and the next steps needed to continue to evaluate postgraduate medical e-learning may be outlined.
Objective: This study aimed to identify and compare the outcomes and methods used to evaluate postgraduate medical e-learning.
Methods: We performed a systematic literature review using the Web of Science, PubMed, Education Resources Information Center, and Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature databases. Studies that used postgraduates as participants and evaluated any form of e-learning were included. Studies without any evaluation outcome (eg, just a description of e-learning) were excluded.
Results: The initial search identified 5973 articles, of which we used 418 for our analysis. The types of studies were trials, prospective cohorts, case reports, and reviews. The primary outcomes of the included studies were knowledge, skills, and attitude. A total of 12 instruments were used to evaluate a specific primary outcome, such as laparoscopic skills or stress related to training. The secondary outcomes mainly evaluated satisfaction, motivation, efficiency, and usefulness. We found 13 e-learning design methods across 19 studies (4\% 19/418). The methods evaluated usability, motivational characteristics, and the use of learning styles or were based on instructional design theories, such as Gagne’s instructional design, the Heidelberg inventory, Kern’s curriculum development steps, and a scale based on the cognitive load theory. Finally, 2 instruments attempted to evaluate several aspects of a design, based on the experience of creating e-learning.
Conclusions: Evaluating the effect of e-learning design is complicated. Given the diversity of e-learning methods, there are many ways to carry out such an evaluation, and probably, many ways to do so correctly. However, the current literature shows us that we have yet to reach any form of consensus about which indicators to evaluate. There is a great need for an evaluation tool that is properly constructed, validated, and tested. This could be a more homogeneous way to compare the effects of e-learning and for the authors of e-learning to continue to improve their product.},

	abstract = {Background: Mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets, and laptop computers enable users to search for information and communicate with others at any place and any time. Such devices are increasingly being used at universities for teaching and learning. The use of mobile devices by students depends, among others, on the individual media literacy level and the curricular framework. Objective: The objective of this study was to explore whether there were differences in media use in students from various curricula at the Faculty of Health, Witten/Herdecke University. Methods: During the 2015-16 winter term, a survey was conducted at the Faculty of Health, Witten/Herdecke University, in which a total of 705 students (out of 1091 students; response rate: 705/1091, 64.61\%) from 4 schools participated voluntarily: medicine (346/598), dentistry (171/204), psychology (142/243), and nursing science (46/46). The questionnaire developed for the study included 132 questions on 4 topics: (1) electronic and mobile devices (19 questions), (2) communication and organization of learning (45 questions), (3) apps/programs/websites/media (34 questions), and (4) media literacy (34 questions). The questionnaire was distributed and anonymously completed during in-class courses. Results: Students from all 4 schools had at least two electronic devices, with smartphones (97.4\%, 687/705) and laptops (94.8\%, 669/705) being the most common ones. Students agreed that electronic devices enabled them to effectively structure the learning process (mean 3.16, SD 0.62) and shared the opinion that university teaching should include imparting media literacy (mean 2.84, SD 0.84). Electronic device ownership was the highest among medical students (mean 2.68, SD 0.86) and medical students were the only ones to use a tutorial (36.1\%, 125/346). Dental students most widely used text messages (mean 3.41, SD 0.49) and social media (mean 2.57, SD 1.10) to organize learning. Psychology students considered mobile devices to be most ineffective (mean 2.81, SD 0.83). Nursing science students used emails (mean 3.47, SD 0.73) and desktop computers (39\%, 18/46) most widely. Conclusions: The results show that almost all students use electronic learning (e-learning) tools. At the same time, different profiles for different degree programs become apparent, which are to be attributed to not only the varying curricula and courses but also to the life circumstances of different age groups. Universities should, therefore, pay attention to the diverse user patterns and media literacy levels of students when planning courses to enable successful use of e-learning methods.},

	abstract = {Background: The WhatsApp smartphone app is the most widely used instant messaging app in the world. Recent studies reported the use of WhatsApp for educational purposes, but there is no prospective study comparing WhatsApp?s pedagogical effectiveness to that of any other teaching modality. Objective: The main objective of this study was to measure the impact of a learning program via WhatsApp on clinical reasoning in medical residents. Methods: This prospective, randomized, multicenter study was conducted among first- and second-year anesthesiology residents (offline recruitment) from four university hospitals in France. Residents were randomized in two groups of online teaching (WhatsApp and control). The WhatsApp group benefited from daily delivery of teaching documents on the WhatsApp app and a weekly clinical case supervised by a senior physician. In the control group, residents had access to the same documents via a traditional computer electronic learning (e-learning) platform. Medical reasoning was self-assessed online by a script concordance test (SCT; primary parameter), and medical knowledge was assessed using multiple-choice questions (MCQs). The residents also completed an online satisfaction questionnaire. Results: In this study, 62 residents were randomized (32 to the WhatsApp group and 30 to the control group) and 22 residents in each group answered the online final evaluation. We found a difference between the WhatsApp and control groups for SCTs (60\% [SD 9\%] vs 68\% [SD 11\%]; P=.006) but no difference for MCQs (18/30 [SD 4] vs 16/30 [SD 4]; P=.22). Concerning satisfaction, there was a better global satisfaction rate in the WhatsApp group than in the control group (8/10 [interquartile range 8-9] vs 8/10 [interquartile range 8-8]; P=.049). Conclusions: Compared to traditional e-learning, the use of WhatsApp for teaching residents was associated with worse clinical reasoning despite better global appreciation. The use of WhatsApp probably contributes to the dispersion of attention linked to the use of the smartphone. The impact of smartphones on clinical reasoning should be studied further.},

	abstract = {Background: Healthcare professionals are key informants to support individual behaviour change, and although there has been some progress in empowering clinicians to promote physical activity and health at work, an effective strategy overarching the whole medical educational journey is still lacking. This report provides an overview from the Moving Healthcare Professionals programme (MHPP), a whole-system educational approach to embed prevention and physical activity promotion into clinical practice.
Methods: The MHPP model integrates educational resources into three core domains of medical education: undergraduate education, postgraduate education and continuing professional development. The interventions are designed to spiral through existing educational approaches rather than as additional special study modules or bolton courses, thus reducing self-selection bias in exposure. Interventions include spiral undergraduate education materials, e-learning, embedded post-graduate resources and face-to-face peer-to-peer education.
Results: To date the MHPP model has been applied in two key areas, physical activity and health and work. The physical activity programme in a partnership between Public Health England and Sport England has delivered face-to-face training to 17,105 healthcare professionals, embedded materials in almost three quarters of English medical schools and overseen {\textgreater} 95,000 e-learning modules completed over two and half years. Evaluation of the individual elements of the model is ongoing and aims to show improvements in knowledge, skills and practice. Further evaluation is planned to assess patient impact.
Conclusions: The MHPP model offers a coherent whole-system approach to embed public health action into existing healthcare education models, and as such provides a framework for rapid change as well as upstream implementation to support the clinicians of today and tomorrow.},

	abstract = {Background: Zambia is faced with a severe shortage of health workers and challenges in national health financing. This burdens the medical licentiate practitioner (MLP) program for training nonphysician clinical students in Zambia because of the shortage of qualified medical lecturers and learning resources at training sites. To address this shortage and strengthen the MLP program, a self-directed electronic health (eHealth) platform was introduced, comprising technology-supported learning (e-learning) for medical education and support for health care practice. MLP students were provided with tablets that were preloaded with content for offline access. Objective: This study aimed to explore MLP students? and medical lecturers? perceptions of the self-directed eHealth platform with an offline-based tablet as a training and health care practice support tool during the first year of full implementation. Methods: We conducted in-depth qualitative interviews with 8 MLP students and 5 lecturers and 2 focus group discussions with 16 students to gain insights on perceptions of the usefulness, ease of use, and adequacy of self-directed e-learning and health care practice support accessible through the offline-based tablet. Participants were purposively sampled. Verbatim transcripts were analyzed following hypothesis coding. Results: The eHealth platform (e-platform), comprising e-learning for medical education and health care practice support, was positively received by students and medical lecturers and was seen as a step toward modernizing the MLP program. Tablets enabled equal access to offline learning contents, thus bridging the gap of slow or no internet connections. The study results indicated that the e-platform appears adequate to strengthen medical education within this low-resource setting. However, student self-reported usage was low, and medical lecturer usage was even lower. One stated reason was the lack of training in tablet usage and another was the quality of the tablets. The mediocre quality and quantity of most e-learning contents were perceived as a primary concern as materials were reported to be outdated, missing multimedia features, and addressing only part of the curriculum. Medical lecturers were noted to have little commitment to updating or creating new learning materials. Suggestions for improving the e-platform were given. Conclusions: To address identified major challenges, we plan to (1) introduce half-day training sessions at the beginning of each study year to better prepare users for tablet usage, (2) further update and expand e-learning content by fostering collaborations with MLP program stakeholders and nominating an e-platform coordinator, (3) set up an e-platform steering committee including medical lecturers, (4) incorporate e-learning and e-based health care practice support across the curriculum, as well as (5) implement processes to promote user-generated content. With these measures, we aim to sustainably strengthen the MLP program by implementing the tablet-based e-platform as a serious learning technology for medical education and health care practice support.},

	abstract = {Background: Improving practice nurses? (PN) adherence to smoking cessation counseling guidelines will benefit the quality of smoking cessation care and will potentially lead to higher smoking abstinence rates. However, support programs to aid PNs in improving their guideline uptake and adherence do not exist yet. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the effects of a novel computer-tailored electronic learning (e-learning) program on PNs? smoking cessation guideline adherence. Methods: A Web-based randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted in which an intervention group (N=147) with full access to the e-learning program for 6 months was compared with a control group (N=122) without access. Data collection was fully automated at baseline and 6-month follow-up via online questionnaires, assessing PNs? demographics, work-related factors, potential behavioral predictors based on the I-Change model, and guideline adherence. PNs also completed counseling checklists to retrieve self-reported counseling activities for each consultation with a smoker (N=1175). To assess the program?s effectiveness in improving PNs? guideline adherence (ie, overall adherence and adherence to individual counseling guideline steps), mixed linear and logistic regression analyses were conducted, thus accommodating for the smokers being nested within PNs. Potential effect moderation by work-related factors and behavioral predictors was also examined. Results: After 6 months, 121 PNs in the intervention group (82.3\%, 121/147) and 103 in the control group (84.4\%, 103/122) completed the follow-up questionnaire. Mixed linear regression analysis revealed that counseling experience moderated the program?s effect on PNs? overall guideline adherence (beta=.589; 95\% CI 0.111-1.068; PHolm-Bonferroni =.048), indicating a positive program effect on adherence for PNs with a more than average level of counseling experience. Mixed logistic regression analyses regarding adherence to individual guideline steps revealed a trend toward moderating effects of baseline levels of behavioral predictors and counseling experience. More specifically, for PNs with less favorable scores on behavioral predictors (eg, low baseline self-efficacy) and high levels of counseling experience, the program significantly increased adherence. Conclusions: Results from our RCT showed that among PNs with more than average counseling experience, the e-learning program resulted in significantly better smoking cessation guideline adherence. Experienced PNs might have been better able to translate the content of our e-learning program into practically applicable counseling strategies compared with less experienced colleagues. Less favorable baseline levels of behavioral predictors among PNs possibly contributed to this effect, as there was more room for improvement by consulting the tailored content of the e-learning program. To further substantiate the effectiveness of e-learning programs on guideline adherence by health care professionals (HCPs), it is important to assess how to support a wider range of HCPs.

	abstract = {Background: Early detection of congenital heart disease is a worldwide problem. This is more critical in developing countries, where shortage of professional specialists and structural health care problems are a constant. E-learning has the potential to improve capacity, by overcoming distance barriers and by its ability to adapt to the reduced time of health professionals. Objective: The study aimed to develop an e-learning pediatric cardiology basics course and evaluate its pedagogical impact and user satisfaction. Methods: The sample consisted of 62 health professionals, including doctors, nurses, and medical students, from 20 hospitals linked via a telemedicine network in Northeast Brazil. The course was developed using Moodle (Modular Object Oriented Dynamic Learning Environment; Moodle Pty Ltd, Perth, Australia) and contents adapted from a book on this topic. Pedagogical impact evaluation used a pre and posttest approach. User satisfaction was evaluated using Wang?s questionnaire. Results: Pedagogical impact results revealed differences in knowledge assessment before and after the course (Z=?4.788; P{\textless}.001). Questionnaire results indicated high satisfaction values (Mean=87\%; SD=12\%; minimum=67\%; maximum=100\%). Course adherence was high (79\%); however, the withdrawal exhibited a value of 39\%, with the highest rate in the early chapters. Knowledge gain revealed significant differences according to the profession (X22=8.6; P=.01) and specialty (X22=8.4; P=.04). Time dedication to the course was significantly different between specialties (X22=8.2; P=.04). Conclusions: The main contributions of this study are the creation of an asynchronous e-learning course on Moodle and the evaluation of its impact, confirming that e-learning is a viable tool to improve training in neonatal congenital heart diseases.},

	abstract = {Background: Workplaces today demand graduates who are prepared with field-specific knowledge, advanced social skills, problem-solving skills, and integration capabilities. Meeting these goals with didactic learning (DL) is becoming increasingly difficult. Enhanced training methods that would better prepare tomorrow?s graduates must be more engaging and game-like, such as feedback based e-learning or simulation-based training, while saving time. Empirical evidence regarding the effectiveness of advanced learning methods is lacking. Objective quantitative research comparing advanced training methods with DL is sparse. Objectives: This quantitative study assessed the effectiveness of a computerized interactive simulator coupled with an instructor who monitored students? progress and provided Web-based immediate feedback. Methods: A low-cost, globally accessible, telemedicine simulator, developed at the Technion?Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel?was used. A previous study in the field of interventional cardiology, evaluating the efficacy of the simulator to enhanced learning via knowledge exams, presented promising results of average scores varying from 94\% after training and 54\% before training (n=20) with P{\textless}.001. Two independent experiments involving obstetrics and gynecology (Ob-Gyn) physicians and senior ultrasound sonographers, with 32 subjects, were conducted using a new interactive concept of the WOZ (Wizard of OZ) simulator platform. The contribution of an instructor to learning outcomes was evaluated by comparing students? knowledge before and after each interactive instructor-led session as well as after fully automated e-learning in the field of Ob-Gyn. Results from objective knowledge tests were analyzed using hypothesis testing and model fitting. Results: A significant advantage (P=.01) was found in favor of the WOZ training approach. Content type and training audience were not significant. Conclusions: This study evaluated the contribution of an integrated teaching environment using a computerized interactive simulator, with an instructor providing immediate Web-based immediate feedback to trainees. Involvement of an instructor in the simulation-based training process provided better learning outcomes that varied training content and trainee populations did not affect the overall learning gains.},

	abstract = {Background: Physicians need global health competencies to provide effective care to culturally and linguistically diverse patients. Medical schools are seeking innovative approaches to support global health learning. This pilot study evaluated e-learning versus peer-reviewed articles to improve conceptual knowledge of global health.
Methods: A mixed methods study using a randomized-controlled trial (RCT) and qualitative inquiry consisting of four post-intervention focus groups. Outcomes included pre/post knowledge quiz and self-assessment measures based on validated tools from a Global Health CanMEDS Competency Model. RCT results were analyzed using SPSS-21 and focus group transcripts coded using NVivo-9 and recoded using thematic analysis.
Results: One hundred and sixty-one pre-clerkship medical students from three Canadian medical schools participated in 2012–2013: 59 completed all elements of the RCT, 24 participated in the focus groups. Overall, comparing pre to post results, both groups showed a significant increase in the mean knowledge (quiz) scores and for 5/7 self-assessed competencies (p {\textless} 0.05). These quantitative data were triangulated with the focus groups findings that revealed knowledge acquisition with both approaches. There was no statistically significant difference between the two approaches. Participants highlighted their preference for e-learning to introduce new global health knowledge and as a repository of resources. They also mentioned personal interest in global health, online convenience and integration into the curriculum as incentives to complete the e-learning. Beta version e-learning barriers included content overload and technical difficulties.
Conclusions: Both the e-learning and the peer reviewed PDF articles improved global health conceptual knowledge. Many students however, preferred e-learning given its interactive, multi-media approach, access to links and reference materials and its capacity to engage and re-engage over long periods of time.},

	abstract = {Background: Technology-Enhanced Learning (TEL) can be used to educate Foundation Programme trainee (F1 and F2) doctors. Despite the advantages of TEL, learning behaviours may be exhibited that are not desired by system developers or educators. The aim of this evaluation was to investigate how learner behaviours (e.g. time spent on task) were affected by temporal (e.g. time of year), module (e.g. word count), and individual (e.g. knowledge) factors for 16 mandatory TEL modules related to prescribing and therapeutics.
Methods: Data were extracted from the SCRIPT e-Learning platform for first year Foundation trainee (F1) doctors in the Health Education England’s West Midland region from 1st August 2013 to 5th August 2014. Generalised Estimating Equation models were used to examine the relationship between time taken to complete modules, date modules were completed, pre- and post-test scores, and module factors.
Results: Over the time period examined, 688 F1 doctors interacted with the 16 compulsory modules 10,255 times. The geometric mean time taken to complete a module was 28.9 min (95 \% Confidence Interval: 28.4–29.5) and 1,075 (10.5 \%) modules were completed in less than 10 min. In February and June (prior to F1 progression reviews) peaks occurred in the number of modules completed and troughs in the time taken. Most modules were completed, and the greatest amount of time was spent on the learning on a Sunday. More time was taken by those doctors with greater pre-test scores and those with larger improvements in test scores.
Conclusions: Foundation trainees are exhibiting unintended learning behaviours in this TEL environment, which may be attributed to several factors. These findings can help guide future developments of this TEL programme and the integration of other TEL programmes into curricula by raising awareness of potential behavioural issues that may arise.},

Specific training may enable them to more optimally refer patients to genetic counseling. Objective: The aim of this study was to develop an e-learning module for gastroenterologists and surgeons (in training) aimed at improving attitudes, knowledge, and comprehension of communication skills, and to assess the feasibility of the e-learning module for continued medical education of these specialists. Methods: A focus group helped to inform the development of a training framework. The e-learning module was then developed, followed by a feasibility test among a group of surgeons-in-training (3rd- and 4th-year residents) and then among gastroenterologists, using pre- and posttest questionnaires. Results: A total of 124 surgeons-in-training and 14 gastroenterologists participated. The e-learning was positively received (7.5 on a scale of 1 to 10). Between pre- and posttest, attitude increased significantly on 6 out of the 10 items. Mean test score showed that knowledge and comprehension of communication skills improved significantly from 49\% to 72\% correct at pretest to 67\% to 87\% correct at posttest. Conclusions: This study shows the feasibility of a problem-based e-learning module to help surgeons-in-training and gastroenterologists in recognizing a hereditary predisposition in patients with CRC. The e-learning led to improvements in attitude toward the assessment of cancer family history, knowledge on criteria for referral to genetic counseling for CRC, and comprehension of communication skills.},

	abstract = {Background: Traditional approaches to health professional education are being challenged by increased clinical demands and decreased available time. Web-based e-learning tools offer a convenient and effective method of delivering education, particularly across multiple health care facilities. The effectiveness of this model for health professional education needs to be explored in context. Objectives: The study aimed to (1) determine health professionals? experience and knowledge of clinical use of vancomycin, an antibiotic used for treatment of serious infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and (2) describe the design and implementation of a Web-based e-learning tool created to improve knowledge in this area. Methods: We conducted a study on the design and implementation of a video-enhanced, Web-based e-learning tool between April 2014 and January 2016. A Web-based survey was developed to determine prior experience and knowledge of vancomycin use among nurses, doctors, and pharmacists. The Vancomycin Interactive (VI) involved a series of video clips interspersed with question and answer scenarios, where a correct response allowed for progression. Dramatic tension and humor were used as tools to engage users. Health professionals? knowledge of clinical vancomycin use was obtained from website data; qualitative participant feedback was also collected. Results: From the 577 knowledge survey responses, pharmacists (n=70) answered the greatest number of questions correctly (median score 4/5), followed by doctors (n=271; 3/5) and nurses (n=236; 2/5; P{\textless}.001). Survey questions on target trough concentration (75.0\%, 433/577) and rate of administration (64.9\%, 375/577) were answered most correctly, followed by timing of first level (49\%, 283/577), maintenance dose (41.9\%, 242/577), and loading dose (38.0\%, 219/577). Self-reported ?very? and ?reasonably? experienced health professionals were also more likely to achieve correct responses. The VI was completed by 163 participants during the study period. The rate of correctly answered VI questions on first attempt was 65\% for nurses (n=63), 68\% for doctors (n=86), and 82\% for pharmacists (n=14; P{\textless}.001), reflecting a similar pattern to the knowledge survey. Knowledge gaps were identified for loading dose (39.2\% correct on first attempt; 64/163), timing of first trough level (50.3\%, 82/163), and subsequent trough levels (47.9\%, 78/163). Of the 163 participants, we received qualitative user feedback from 51 participants following completion of the VI. Feedback was predominantly positive with themes of ?entertaining,? ?engaging,? and ?fun? identified; however, there were some technical issues identified relating to accessibility from different operating systems and browsers. Conclusions: A novel Web-based e-learning tool was successfully developed combining game design principles and humor to improve user engagement. Knowledge gaps were identified that allowed for targeting of future education strategies. The VI provides an innovative model for delivering Web-based education to busy health professionals in different locations.},

	abstract = {Background: This paper presents a critical reflection of the integration of Blended Learning (BL) into an undergraduate occupational therapy curriculum which was delivered through Problem Based Learning (PBL).
Method: This is a qualitative reflection of a Participatory Action Research (PAR) study using Brookfield’s model for critical reflection of an educator’s practice. The model uses four ‘lenses’ through which to focus enquiry: Lens 1) our autobiography as a learner of practice; Lens 2) our learners’ eyes; Lens 3) our colleagues’ experiences; and Lens 4) the theoretical literature. Grounded theory analysis was applied to the data.
Results: The factors that contributed to successful integration of technology and e-Learning into an existing curriculum, the hurdles that were navigated along the way, and how these influenced decisions and innovation are explored. The core categories identified in the data were “drivers of change” and “outcomes of BL integration”. Key situations and pivotal events are highlighted for their role in the process that led to the project maturing. Each lens reflects the successes and hurdles experienced during the study.
Conclusion: Brookfield’s model provides an objective method of reflection which showed that despite the hurdles, e-Learning was successfully integrated into the curriculum.},

Video-based e-learning use is increasing, with initial research suggesting that taking short breaks while watching videos (independent of answering test questions) may improve learning by focusing attention on the content presented. Interspersed test questions may also improve knowledge acquisition and retention. Objective: To examine the effect of interspersed test questions and periodic breaks on immediate knowledge acquisition and retention at 6 months by pediatric residents engaged in video-based e-learning. Methods: First- and second-year pediatric residents were randomized to 1 of the following 3 groups: viewing the complete video uninterrupted (full video), viewing the video interrupted with unrelated logic puzzles (logic puzzles), or viewing the video interrupted with brief comprehension test questions (short answer questions). Residents answered pre- and post-tests before and after video viewing, followed by a retention test at 6 months. Primary outcome included comparison of the change in test scores between groups. Results: A total of 49 residents completed the initial testing session. All 3 learning groups had comparable mean increases in immediate knowledge gain, but with no significant differences between groups (F2,46=0.35, P=.71). Thirty-five residents completed retention testing with comparable degrees of knowledge retention in the full video and short answer test questions groups (P{\textless}.001), but no significant change in the logic puzzles group (F1,32=2.44, P=.13). Conclusions: Improved knowledge gain was not demonstrated among residents answering interspersed questions or completing logic puzzles during interrupted online video viewing when compared with residents viewing uninterrupted video content. However, residents who either participated in uninterrupted video viewing or answered interspersed questions during interrupted video viewing demonstrated significant knowledge retention at 6 months.},

So far, little data is available on the impact of such approaches on procedural learning and skill acquisition and their comparison with traditional approaches. Objective: This study investigated the impact of a blended learning approach, including Web-based virtual patients (VPs) and standard pediatric basic life support (PBLS) training, on procedural knowledge, objective performance, and self-assessment. Methods: A total of 57 medical students were randomly assigned to an intervention group (n=30) and a control group (n=27). Both groups received paper handouts in preparation of simulation-based PBLS training. The intervention group additionally completed two Web-based VPs with embedded video clips. Measurements were taken at randomization (t0), after the preparation period (t1), and after hands-on training (t2). Clinical decision-making skills and procedural knowledge were assessed at t0 and t1. PBLS performance was scored regarding adherence to the correct algorithm, conformance to temporal demands, and the quality of procedural steps at t1 and t2. Participants? self-assessments were recorded in all three measurements. Results: Procedural knowledge of the intervention group was significantly superior to that of the control group at t1. At t2, the intervention group showed significantly better adherence to the algorithm and temporal demands, and better procedural quality of PBLS in objective measures than did the control group. These aspects differed between the groups even at t1 (after VPs, prior to practical training). Self-assessments differed significantly only at t1 in favor of the intervention group. Conclusions: Training with VPs combined with hands-on training improves PBLS performance as judged by objective measures.},

	abstract = {Background: Mammography is considered the best imaging technique for breast cancer screening, and the radiographer plays an important role in its performance. Therefore, continuing education is critical to improving the performance of these professionals and thus providing better health care services. Objective: Our goal was to develop an e-learning course on breast imaging for radiographers, assessing its efficacy, effectiveness, and user satisfaction. Methods: A stratified randomized controlled trial was performed with radiographers and radiology students who already had mammography training, using pre- and post-knowledge tests, and satisfaction questionnaires. The primary outcome was the improvement in test results (percentage of correct answers), using intention-to-treat and per-protocol analysis. Results: A total of 54 participants were assigned to the intervention (20 students plus 34 radiographers) with 53 controls (19+34). The intervention was completed by 40 participants (11+29), with 4 (2+2) discontinued interventions, and 10 (7+3) lost to follow-up. Differences in the primary outcome were found between intervention and control: 21 versus 4 percentage points (pp), P{\textless}.001. Stratified analysis showed effect in radiographers (23 pp vs 4 pp; P=.004) but was unclear in students (18 pp vs 5 pp; P=.098). Nonetheless, differences in students? posttest results were found (88\% vs 63\%; P=.003), which were absent in pretest (63\% vs 63\%; P=.106). The per-protocol analysis showed a higher effect (26 pp vs 2 pp; P{\textless}.001), both in students (25 pp vs 3 pp; P=.004) and radiographers (27 pp vs 2 pp; P{\textless}.001). Overall, 85\% were satisfied with the course, and 88\% considered it successful. Conclusions: This e-learning course is effective, especially for radiographers, which highlights the need for continuing education.},

	abstract = {Background: The mEducator Best Practice Network (BPN) implemented and extended standards and reference models in e-learning to develop innovative frameworks as well as solutions that enable specialized state-of-the-art medical educational content to be discovered, retrieved, shared, and re-purposed across European Institutions, targeting medical students, doctors, educators and health care professionals. Scenario-based evaluation for usability testing, complemented with data from online questionnaires and field notes of users? performance, was designed and utilized for the evaluation of these solutions. Objective: The objective of this work is twofold: (1) to describe one instantiation of the mEducator BPN solutions (mEducator3.0 - ?MEdical Education LINnked Arena? MELINA+) with a focus on the metadata schema used, as well as on other aspects of the system that pertain to usability and acceptance, and (2) to present evaluation results on the suitability of the proposed metadata schema for searching, retrieving, and sharing of medical content and with respect to the overall usability and acceptance of the system from the target users. Methods: A comprehensive evaluation methodology framework was developed and applied to four case studies, which were conducted in four different countries (ie, Greece, Cyprus, Bulgaria and Romania), with a total of 126 participants. In these case studies, scenarios referring to creating, sharing, and retrieving medical educational content using mEducator3.0 were used. The data were collected through two online questionnaires, consisting of 36 closed-ended questions and two open-ended questions that referred to mEducator 3.0 and through the use of field notes during scenario-based evaluations. Results: The main findings of the study showed that even though the informational needs of the mEducator target groups were addressed to a satisfactory extent and the metadata schema supported content creation, sharing, and retrieval from an end-user perspective, users faced difficulties in achieving a shared understanding of the meaning of some metadata fields and in correctly managing the intellectual property rights of repurposed content. Conclusions: The results of this evaluation impact researchers, medical professionals, and designers interested in using similar systems for educational content sharing in medical and other domains. Recommendations on how to improve the search, retrieval, identification, and obtaining of medical resources are provided, by addressing issues of content description metadata, content description procedures, and intellectual property rights for re-purposed content.},

Advantages and limitations for the creation of E-Learning materials within a syndicate are discussed and a survey conducted at six German universities is evaluated in order to indicate the encountered changes precisely. Moreover, the framework including the modularity of the learning materials in combination with the principle of Constructive Alignment is described and analyzed. The empirical data regarding the students and teachers experience with the framework and learning materials collected through the survey are discussed elaborately. Last but not least, a conclusion on the consolidation and continuous use of the learning materials is drawn, which shows that transparent learning objectives help to raise the students’ motivation.},

	abstract = {As of the start of the COVID-19-pandemic, basis undergraduate, postgraduate as well as continuous medical education had often been switched to e-learning. This is a chance and a challenge at the same time. In this work, we describe the e-learning experiences of the competence center for postgraduate medical education in Baden-Württemberg. We aim to support broad implementation of e-learning by the exchange of educational as well as organizational approaches. In March 2020, we planned synchronic (live) webinars with asynchronic preparation and postprocessing (flipped classroom). We focused on elements to improve interaction. All the process was managed with respect to the program curriculum in a multicentered team. In 2020, n = 263 postgraduate trainees in family medicine (FM trainees) participated in n = 12 online single seminar days of the KWBW Verbundweiterbildungplus. Due to multiple participation, they induced n = 379 participations. N = 353 evaluations could be included (93,1 \% response rate). 77 \% (n = 182/236) assessed the use of the software Zoom® with satisfying or very satisfying, 75 \% (n = 122/163) the use of the software Heiconf® with satisfying or very satisfying. 59 \% (n = 208) wanted to continue with seminar days during workdays, whereas 26 \% (n = 91) wished for trainings on Saturdays. A technical check was rated as very helpful. From the organizational point of view, an additional lecturer (= moderator) was necessary. Some lecturers needed extra support in advance of the e-learning. We provide didactic elements that can help to improve the interaction between participants which have to be planned ahead. We present a successful approach to face the educational and organizational challenges of e-learning. E-learning was broadly accepted which supports permanent implementation. However, social and collegial interaction is both, most challenging and most important for postgraduate training in family medicine. Therefore, approaches supporting the interaction in e-learning should be developed and implemented.},

We discuss the appropriate educational scenario, which combines multimedia content, interaction between the collaborative group, and active learning elements, and then we model this scenario with the UML modeling language. As a result, we represent how the design of educational scenarios, provides a better enhancement of the collaborative learning experience through the use of new technologies so that learners are encouraged to reflect on their learning processes and their group's collaboration, thus promoting better understanding.

	abstract = {Background: Health science education faces numerous challenges: assimilation of knowledge, management of increasing numbers of learners or changes in educational models and methodologies. With the emergence of e-learning, the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) and Internet to improve teaching and learning in health science training institutions has become a crucial issue for low and middle income countries, including sub-Saharan Africa. In this perspective, the Faculty of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences (FMBS) of Yaoundé has played a pioneering role in Cameroon in making significant efforts to improve students’ and lecturers’ access to computers and to Internet on its campus. The objective is to investigate how computer literacy and the perception towards e-learning and its potential could contribute to the learning and teaching process within the FMBS academic community.
Method: A cross-sectional survey was carried out among students, residents and lecturers. The data was gathered through a written questionnaire distributed at FMBS campus and analysed with routine statistical software.
Results: 307 participants answered the questionnaire: 218 students, 57 residents and 32 lecturers. Results show that most students, residents and lecturers have access to computers and Internet, although students’ access is mainly at home for computers and at cyber cafés for Internet. Most of the participants have a fairly good mastery of ICT. However, some basic rules of good practices concerning the use of ICT in the health domain were still not well known. Google is the most frequently used engine to retrieve health literature for all participants; only 7\% of students and 16\% of residents have heard about Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). The potential of e-learning in the improvement of teaching and learning still remains insufficiently exploited. About two thirds of the students are not familiar with the concept of e-leaning. 84\% of students and 58\% of residents had never had access to e-learning resources. However, most of the participants perceive the potential of e-learning for learning and teaching, and are in favour of its development at the FMBS.
Conclusion: The strong interest revealed by the study participants to adopt and follow-up the development of elearning, opens new perspectives to a faculty like the FMBS, located in a country with limited resources. However, the success of its development will depend on different factors: the definition of an e-learning strategy, the implementation of concrete measures and the adoption of a more active and participative pedagogy.},

	abstract = {Background: In medical education, information and communication technology (ICT) knowledge and skills have become a necessity and an integral part of preparing tomorrow’s doctors to be sufficiently competent to use informatics resources effectively and efficiently for the best practice of medicine.
Objective: This research aimed to study the literacy of the preprofessional students in ICT before and after taking the basic informatics course at the Health Sciences Center at Kuwait University, to understand their potential and their attitudes toward using ICT, including e-learning.
Methods: A validated questionnaire was used to collect data from 200 students in 2 stages: before and after the informatics course on the preprofessional program. In addition, the tutors’ observational assessments of the students’ achievements during the informatics course were obtained.
Results: The response rate of students before the course was 85.5\% (171/200) and after was 77\% (154/200). Of 200 students, 85\% were female, and 15\% were male. This disproportional representation of genders was due to the fact that 85\% of registered students were female. Approximately 59\% (101/171) of the students assessed themselves before the course as computer literate; afterward, this increased to 70.1\% (108/154). Students who were still computer illiterate (29.2\%; 45/154) mostly used the excuse of a lack of time (60\%; 27/45). In generic ICT skills, the highest levels were for word processing, email, and Web browsing, whereas the lowest levels were for spreadsheets and database. In specific ICT skills, most respondents were reported low levels for statistical package use and Web page design. The results found that there was a significant improvement between students’ general ICT skills before and after the course. The results showed that there were significant improvement between how frequently students were using Medline (P{\textless}.001), Google Scholar (P{\textless}.001), and Cochrane Library (P{\textless}.001) before and after the informatics course. Furthermore, most of the students who completed the course (72.8\%; 110/151) chose the learning management system as the most useful e-learning tool. The results of the tutors’ assessments confirmed the obvious improvement in most of the students’ skills in using ICT.
Conclusions: The ICT knowledge and skills of the students before the course seemed insufficient, and the magnitude of the improvements that were acquired throughout the informatics course was obvious in most of the students’ performance. However, the findings reveal that more practice was required. The attitudes of most of the students toward the potential of e-learning were considered positive, although the potential of Web-based learning in medical training was not well known among the students.},

	abstract = {Background: While the application of learning analytics in tertiary education has received increasing attention in recent years, a much smaller number have explored its use in health care-related educational studies.
Objective: This systematic review aims to examine the use of e-learning analytics data in health care studies with regards to how the analytics is reported and if there is a relationship between e-learning analytics and learning outcomes.
Methods: We performed comprehensive searches of papers from 4 electronic databases (MEDLINE, EBSCOhost, Web of Science, and ERIC) to identify relevant papers. Qualitative studies were excluded from this review. Papers were screened by 2 independent reviewers. We selected qualified studies for further investigation.
Results: A total of 537 papers were screened, and 19 papers were identified. With regards to analytics undertaken, 11 studies reported the number of connections and time spent on e-learning. Learning outcome measures were defined by summative final assessment marks or grades. In addition, significant statistical results of the relationships between e-learning usage and learning outcomes were reported in 12 of the identified papers. In general, students who engaged more in e-learning resources would get better academic attainments. However, 2 papers reported otherwise with better performing students consuming less e-learning videos. A total of 14 papers utilized satisfaction questionnaires for students, and all were positive in their attitude toward e-learning. Furthermore, 6 of 19 papers reported descriptive statistics only, with no statistical analysis.
Conclusions: The nature of e-learning activities reported in this review was varied and not detailed well. In addition, there appeared to be inadequate reporting of learning analytics data observed in over half of the selected papers with regards to definitions and lack of detailed information of what the analytic was recording. Although learning analytics data capture is popular, a lack of detail is apparent with regards to the capturing of meaningful and comparable data. In particular, most analytics record access to a management system or particular e-learning materials, which may not necessarily detail meaningful learning time or interaction. Hence, learning analytics data should be designed to record the time spent on learning and focus on key learning activities. Finally, recommendations are made for future studies.},

	abstract = {Background: The World Health Report (2006) by the World Health Organization conveys that a significant increase is needed in global health care resourcing to meet the current and future demand for health professionals. Electronic learning (e-Learning) presents a possible opportunity to change and optimize training by providing a scalable means for instruction, thus reducing the costs for training health professionals and providing patient education. Research literature often suggests that a benefit of e-Learning is its cost-effectiveness compared with face-to-face instruction, yet there is limited evidence with respect to the comparison of design and production costs with other forms of instruction or the establishment of standards pertaining to budgeting for these costs. Objective: To determine the potential cost favorability of e-Learning in contrast to other forms of learning, there must first be an understanding of the components and elements for building an e-Learning course. Without first taking this step, studies lack the essential financial accounting rigor for course planning and have an inconsistent basis for comparison. This study aimed to (1) establish standard ingredients for the cost of e-Learning course production and (2) determine the variance instructional design has on the production costs of e-Learning courses. Methods: This study made use of a cross-case method among 3 case studies using mixed methods, including horizontal budget variance calculation and qualitative interpretation of responses from course designers for budget variance using total quality management themes. The different implementation-specific aspects of these cases were used to establish common principles in the composition of budgets in the production and delivery of an applied health professional e-Learning course. Results: A total of 2 case studies reported significant negative budget variances caused by issues surrounding underreporting of personnel costs, inaccurate resource task estimation, lack of contingency planning, challenges in third-party resource management, and the need to update health-related materials that became outdated during course production. The third study reported a positive budget variance because of the cost efficiency derived from previous implementation, the strong working relationship of the course project team, and the use of iterative project management methods. Conclusions: This research suggests that the delivery costs of an e-Learning course could be underestimated or underreported and identifies factors that could be used to better control budgets. Through consistent management of factors affecting the cost of course production, further research could be undertaken using standard economic evaluation methods to evaluate the advantages of using e-Learning.},

	abstract = {This contribution aims to give feedback on the use of Trello, a task management tool, in a context of team coaching in e-learning design. The handling of this digital tool was carried out in the framework of the Erasmus+ CoNeCTE project in partnership with Lebanese higher education institutions. In the framework of this research, the Pedagogical Engineering and Digital Education Service (UMONS) accompanies teacher-researchers in the design of virtual learning environments. In order to monitor them, we created dashboards combining the Kanban method and the ADDIE model. Focus groups were conducted with the design teams to analyse the usability and usefulness of the Trello tool in this context. Our results show that Trello is a fast, efficient and easy-to-use tool for managing a project remotely, visualising progress, encouraging collaboration and supporting design teams. This contribution is also an opportunity to write some recommendations about the integration of the Trello tool in a team support context.},

	abstract = {Background: By adaptation of the face-to-face physiotherapist-training program previously used in the Self-management of Osteoarthritis and Low back pain through Activity and Skills (SOLAS) feasibility trial, an asynchronous, interactive, Web-based, e-learning training program (E-SOLAS) underpinned by behavior and learning theories was developed. Objective: This study investigated the effect of the E-SOLAS training program on relevant outcomes of effective training and implementation. Methods: Thirteen physiotherapists from across Ireland were trained via E-SOLAS by using mixed methods, and seven physiotherapists progressed to implementation of the 6-week group-based SOLAS intervention. The effectiveness of E-SOLAS was evaluated using the Kirkpatrick model at the levels of reaction (physiotherapist engagement and satisfaction with E-SOLAS training methods and content), learning (pre- to posttraining changes in physiotherapists? confidence and knowledge in delivering SOLAS content and self-determination theory-based communication strategies, administered via a SurveyMonkey questionnaire), and behavior (fidelity to delivery of SOLAS content using physiotherapist-completed weekly checklists). During implementation, five physiotherapists audio recorded delivery of one class, and the communication between physiotherapists and clients was assessed using the Health Care Climate Questionnaire (HCCQ), the Controlling Coach Behaviour Scale (CCBS), and an intervention-specific measure (ISM; 7-point Likert scale). A range of implementation outcomes were evaluated during training and delivery (ie, acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, fidelity, and sustainability of E-SOLAS) using a posttraining feedback questionnaire and individual semistructured telephone interviews. Results: With regard to their reaction, physiotherapists (n=13) were very satisfied with E-SOLAS posttraining (median 5.0; interquartile range 1.0; min-max 4.0-5.0) and completed training within 3-4 weeks. With regard to learning, there were significant increases in physiotherapists? confidence and knowledge in delivery of all SOLAS intervention components (P{\textless}.05). Physiotherapists? confidence in 7 of 10 self-determination theory-based communication strategies increased (P{\textless}.05), whereas physiotherapists? knowledge of self-determination theory-based strategies remained high posttraining (P{\textgreater}.05). In terms of behavior, physiotherapists delivered SOLAS in a needs supportive manner (HCCQ: median 5.2, interquartile range 1.3, min-max 3.7-5.8; CCBS: median 6.6, interquartile range 1.0, min-max 5.6-7.0; ISM: median 4.5, interquartile range 1.2, min-max 2.8-4.8). Fidelity scores were high for SOLAS content delivery (total \%mean fidelity score 93.5\%; SD 4.9\%). The posttraining questionnaire and postdelivery qualitative interviews showed that physiotherapists found E-SOLAS acceptable, appropriate, feasible, and sustainable within primary care services to support the implementation of the SOLAS intervention. Conclusions: This study provides preliminary evidence of the effectiveness, acceptability, and feasibility of an e-learning program to train physiotherapists to deliver a group-based self-management complex intervention in primary care settings, which is equivalent to face-to-face training outcomes and would support inclusion of physiotherapists in a definitive trial of SOLAS.},

Although numerous studies have investigated the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on universities in the Middle East, none have reflected on the process through which medical education programs for health professions underwent this transition. This study aimed to elucidate the rapid transition to distance-learning of an undergraduate medical program at the College of Medicine, Mohammad Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences (Dubai, United Arab Emirates), owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. An action research approach constituted the foundation of this collaborative effort that involved investigations, reflections, and improvements of practice, through ongoing cycles of planning, acting, observing, and reflecting. Efforts of transitioning to distance-learning were grouped into four interrelated aspects: supporting faculty members in delivering the program content, managing curriculum changes, engaging with the students to facilitate distance-learning experiences, and conducting web-based assessments. Challenges included the high perceived uncertainty, need for making ad hoc decisions, lack of experiential learning and testing of clinical skills, and blurring of work-life boundaries. Our preliminary findings show the successful generation of a strong existing digital base, future prospects for innovation, and a cohesive team that was key to agility, rapid decision-making, and program implementation.},

	abstract = {Background: The profession of practicing medicine is based on communication, and as social media and other digital technologies play a major role in today?s communication, digital literacy must be included in the medical curriculum. The value of social media has been demonstrated several times in medicine and health care, therefore it is time to prepare medical students for the conditions they will have to face when they graduate. Objective: The aim of our study was to design a new e-learning-based curriculum and test it with medical students. Method: An elective course was designed to teach students how to use the Internet, with a special emphasis on social media. An e-learning platform was also made available and students could access material about using digital technologies on the online platforms they utilized the most. All students filled in online surveys before and after the course in order to provide feedback about the curriculum. Results: Over a 3-year period, 932 students completed the course. The course did not increase the number of hours spent online but aimed at making that time more efficient and useful. Based on the responses of students, they found the information provided by the curriculum useful for their studies and future practices. Conclusions: A well-designed course, improved by constant evaluation-based feedback, can be suitable for preparing students for the massive use of the Internet, social media platforms, and digital technologies. New approaches must be applied in modern medical education in order to teach students new skills. Such curriculums that put emphasis on reaching students on the online channels they use in their studies and everyday lives introduce them to the world of empowered patients and prepare them to deal with the digital world.},

Methoden: Von den 31 deutschen Einrichtungen für Geschichte, Theorie und Ethik der Medizin, die gefragt wurden, den Fragebogen auszufüllen, haben 30 geantwortet, was einer Rücklaufquote von 97\% entspricht. Die telefonische Befragung fand zwischen Juli und August 2012 statt. Ergebnisse: Der Einsatz digitaler interaktiver Lehrmaterialien, die web- basiert den Studierenden zur Verfügung gestellt werden, hat in den vergangenen Jahren eine Konjunktur an deutschen Einrichtungen für die Bereiche Geschichte, Theorie und Ethik der Medizin erfahren. Dieser Trend wird sich weiter fortsetzen, da mehr als die Hälfte (67\%) der Einrichtungen ihre bisherigen E-Learning-Angebote ausbauen will. In den vergangenen Jahren sind vor allem Angebote für Medizinische Terminologie entstanden. Viele Einrichtungen möchten künftig ihre Angebote für Medizinische Terminologie weiterentwickeln. Insgesamt wurden die E-Learning-Angebote von den Studierenden sehr gut aufge- nommen. 57\% der Einrichtungen gaben an, dass 90-100\% der Studie- renden die Angebote regelmäßig nutzen.
Schlussfolgerungen: Dieser Artikel diskutiert die Ergebnisse einer um- fangreichen empirischen Studie über E-Learning. Er zeigt den Rahmen auf, in dem deutsche Einrichtungen vorhaben, ihre E-Learning-Optionen in der Zukunft auszuweiten. Schließlich werden spezifische Vorschläge für die Zusammenarbeit unter den Einrichtungen (nicht nur online) ge- macht, deren Ziel es ist, Synergien im Bereich E-Learning zu erzeugen.},

	abstract = {Background: E-Learning programs and their corresponding devices are increasingly employed to educate dental students during their clinical training. Objective: Recent progress made in the development of e-learning software as well as in hardware (computers, tablet PCs, smartphones) caused us to more closely investigate into the habits of dental students in dealing with these learning techniques. Methods: Dental students during their clinical training attended a survey compiled in cooperation with biostatisticians. The questionnaire probands were asked to complete based on previous surveys of similar subjects, allowing single as well as multiple answers. The data, which were obtained with respect to the learning devices students commonly employ, were compared with their internet learning activities. Results: The e-learning devices utilized are of heterogeneous brands. Each student has access to at least one hardware type suitable for e-learning. All students held mobile devices, about 90 percent employed laptops, and about 60 percent possess smartphones. Unexceptional all participants of the survey acknowledged an unlimited internet access. In contrast, only 16 percent of students utilized tablet PCs. A detailed analysis of the survey outcome reveals that an increasing use of mobile devices (tablet PC, smartphone) facilitates internet learning activities while at the same time utilization of computers (desktop, laptop) declines. Conclusions: Dental students overwhelmingly accept e-learning during their clinical training. Students report outstanding preconditions to conduct e-learning as both their access to hardware and to the internet is excellent. Less satisfying is the outcome of our survey regarding the utilization of e-learning programs. Depending of the hardware employed only one-third to barely one-half of students comprise learning programs.},

	abstract = {Background: Brief motivational interviewing (MI) can contribute to reductions in morbidity and mortality related to coronary artery disease, through health behavior change. Brief MI, unlike more intensive interventions, was proposed to meet the needs of clinicians with little spare time. While the provision of face-to-face brief MI training on a large scale is complicated, Web-based e-learning is promising because of the flexibility it offers. Objective: The primary objective of this pilot study was to examine the feasibility and acceptability of a Web-based e-learning platform for brief MI (MOTIV@C?UR), which was evaluated by nurses in cardiovascular care. The secondary objective was to assess the preliminary effect of the training on nurses? perceived brief MI skills and self-reported clinical use of brief MI. Methods: We conducted a single-group, pre-post pilot study involving nurses working in a coronary care unit to evaluate MOTIV@C?UR, which is a Web-based e-learning platform for brief MI, consisting of two sessions lasting 30 and 20 minutes. MOTIV@C?UR covers 4 real-life clinical situations through role-modeling videos showing nurse-client interactions. A brief introduction to MI is followed by role playing, during which a nurse practitioner evaluates clients? motivation to change and intervenes according to the principles of brief MI. The clinical situations target smoking, medication adherence, physical activity, and diet. Nurses were asked to complete both Web-based training sessions asynchronously within 20 days, which allowed assessment of the feasibility of the intervention. Data regarding acceptability and preliminary effects (perceived skills in brief MI, and self-reported clinical use of conviction and confidence interventions) were self-assessed through Web-based questionnaires 30 days (�5 days) after the first session. Results: We enrolled 27 women and 4 men (mean age 37, SD 9 years) in March 2016. Of the 31 participants, 24 (77\%, 95\% CI 63\%?91\%) completed both sessions in ?20 days. At 30 days, 28 of the 31 participants (90\%) had completed at least one session. The training was rated as highly acceptable, with the highest scores observed for information quality (mean 6.26, SD 0.60; scale 0?7), perceived ease of use (mean 6.16, SD 0.78; scale 0?7), and system quality (mean 6.15, SD 0.58; scale 0?7). Posttraining scores for self-reported clinical use of confidence interventions were higher than pretraining scores (mean 34.72, SD 6.29 vs mean 31.48, SD 6.75, respectively; P=.03; scale 10?50). Other results were nonsignificant. Conclusions: Brief MI training using a Web-based e-learning platform including role-modeling videos is both feasible and acceptable according to cardiovascular care nurses. Further research is required to evaluate the e-learning platform in a randomized controlled trial.

	abstract = {Background: Face-to-face gatekeeper training can be an effective strategy in the enhancement of gatekeepers? knowledge and self-efficacy in adolescent suicide prevention. However, barriers related to access (eg, time, resources) may hamper participation in face-to-face training sessions. The transition to a Web-based setting could address obstacles associated with face-to-face gatekeeper training. Although Web-based suicide prevention training targeting adolescents exists, so far no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been conducted to investigate their efficacy. Objective: This RCT study investigated the efficacy of a Web-based adolescent suicide prevention program entitled Mental Health Online, which aimed to improve the knowledge and self-confidence of gatekeepers working with adolescents (12-20 years old). The program consisted of 8 short e-learning modules each capturing an important aspect of the process of early recognition, guidance, and referral of suicidal adolescents, alongside additional information on the topic of (adolescent) suicide prevention. Methods: A total of 190 gatekeepers (ages 21 to 62 years) participated in this study and were randomized to either the experimental group or waitlist control group. The intervention was not masked. Participants from both groups completed 3 Web-based assessments (pretest, posttest, and 3-month follow-up). The outcome measures of this study were actual knowledge, and participants? ratings of perceived knowledge and perceived self-confidence using questionnaires developed specifically for this study. Results: The actual knowledge, perceived knowledge, and perceived self-confidence of gatekeepers in the experimental group improved significantly compared to those in the waitlist control group at posttest, and the effects remained significant at 3-month follow-up. The overall effect sizes were 0.76, 1.20, and 1.02, respectively, across assessments. Conclusions: The findings of this study indicate that Web-based suicide prevention e-learning modules can be an effective educational method to enhance knowledge and self-confidence of gatekeepers with regard to adolescent suicide prevention. Gatekeepers with limited time and resources can benefit from the accessibility, simplicity, and flexibility of Web-based training.

	abstract = {Background: Adaptive e-learning environments (AEEs) can provide tailored instruction by adapting content, navigation, presentation, multimedia, and tools to each user?s navigation behavior, individual objectives, knowledge, and preferences. AEEs can have various levels of complexity, ranging from systems using a simple adaptive functionality to systems using artificial intelligence. While AEEs are promising, their effectiveness for the education of health professionals and health professions students remains unclear. Objective: The purpose of this systematic review is to assess the effectiveness of AEEs in improving knowledge, competence, and behavior in health professionals and students. Methods: We will follow the Cochrane Collaboration and the Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group guidelines on systematic review methodology. A systematic search of the literature will be conducted in 6 bibliographic databases (CINAHL, EMBASE, ERIC, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science) using the concepts ?adaptive e-learning environments,? ?health professionals/students,? and ?effects on knowledge/skills/behavior.? We will include randomized and nonrandomized controlled trials, in addition to controlled before-after, interrupted time series, and repeated measures studies published between 2005 and 2017. The title and the abstract of each study followed by a full-text assessment of potentially eligible studies will be independently screened by 2 review authors. Using the EPOC extraction form, 1 review author will conduct data extraction and a second author will validate the data extraction. The methodological quality of included studies will be independently assessed by 2 review authors using the EPOC risk of bias criteria. Included studies will be synthesized by a descriptive analysis. Where appropriate, data will be pooled using meta-analysis by applying the RevMan software version 5.1, considering the heterogeneity of studies. Results: The review is in progress. We plan to submit the results in the beginning of 2018. Conclusions: Providing tailored instruction to health professionals and students is a priority in order to optimize learning and clinical outcomes. This systematic review will synthesize the best available evidence regarding the effectiveness of AEEs in improving knowledge, competence, and behavior in health professionals and students. It will provide guidance to policy makers, hospital managers, and researchers in terms of AEE development, implementation, and evaluation in health care.

	abstract = {Background: The use of mobile technology in e-learning (M-TEL) can add new levels of experience and significantly increase the attractiveness of e-learning in medical education. Whether an innovative interactive e-learning multimedia (IM) module or a conventional PowerPoint show (PPS) module using M-TEL to teach emergent otorhinolaryngology?head and neck surgery (ORL-HNS) disorders is feasible and efficient in undergraduate medical students is unknown. Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the impact of a novel IM module with a conventional PPS module using M-TEL for emergent ORL-HNS disorders with regard to learning outcomes, satisfaction, and learning experience. Methods: This pilot study was conducted at an academic teaching hospital and included 24 undergraduate medical students who were novices in ORL-HNS. The cognitive style was determined using the Group Embedded Figures Test. The participants were randomly allocated (1:1) to one of the two groups matched by age, sex, and cognitive style: the IM group and the PPS group. During the 100-min learning period, the participants were unblinded to use the IM or PPS courseware on a 7-inch tablet. Pretests and posttests using multiple-choice questions to evaluate knowledge and multimedia situational tests to evaluate competence were administered. Participants evaluated their satisfaction and learning experience by the AttrakDiff2 questionnaire, and provided feedback about the modules. Results: Overall, the participants had significant gains in knowledge (median of percentage change 71, 95\% CI 1-100, P{\textless}.001) and competence (median of percentage change 25, 95\% CI 0-33, P=.007) after 100 min of learning. Although there was no significant difference in knowledge gain between the two groups (median of difference of percentage change 24, 95\% CI ?75 to 36; P=.55), competence gain was significantly lower in the IM group compared with the PPS group (median of difference of percentage change ?41, 95\% CI ?67 to ?20; P=.008). However, the IM group had significantly higher scores of satisfaction (difference 2, 95\% CI 2-4; P=.01), pragmatic quality (difference 1.7, 95\% CI 0.1-2.7; P=.03), and hedonic stimulation (difference 1.9, 95\% CI 0.3-3.1; P=.01) compared with the PPS group. Qualitative feedback indicated that the various games in the IM module attracted the participants? attention but that the nonlinearly arranged materials affected their learning. Conclusions: Using M-TEL for undergraduate medical education on emergent ORL-HNS disorders, an IM module seems to be useful for gaining knowledge, but competency may need to occur elsewhere. While the small sample size reduces the statistical power of our results, its design seems to be appropriate to determine the effects of M-TEL using a larger group.

	abstract = {Background: In this digital era, there is a growing tendency to use the popular Internet site YouTube as a new electronic-learning (e-learning) means for continuing medical education. Heart transplantation (HTx) remains the most viable option for patients with end-stage heart failure or severe coronary artery disease. There are plenty of freely accessible YouTube videos providing medical information about HTx. Objective: The aim of the present study is to determine the effectiveness of YouTube as an e-learning source on HTx. Methods: In order to carry out this study, YouTube was searched for videos uploaded containing surgical-related information using the four keywords: (1) ?heart transplantation?, (2) ?cardiac transplantation?, (3) ?heart transplantation operation?, and (4) ?cardiac transplantation operation?. Only videos in English (with comments or subtitles in English language) were included. Two experienced cardiac surgeons watched each video (N=1800) and classified them as useful, misleading, or recipients videos based on the HTx-relevant information. The kappa statistic was used to measure interobserver variability. Data was analyzed according to six types of YouTube characteristics including ?total viewership?, ?duration?, ?source?, ?days since upload?, ?scores? given by the viewers, and specialized information contents of the videos. Results: A total of 342/1800  (19.00\%) videos had relevant information about HTx. Of these 342 videos, 215 (62.8\%) videos had useful information about specialized knowledge, 7/342 (2.0\%) were found to be misleading, and 120/342 (35.1\%) only concerned recipients? individual issues. Useful videos had 56.09\% of total viewership share (2,175,845/3,878,890), whereas misleading had 35.47\% (1,375,673/3,878,890). Independent user channel videos accounted for a smaller proportion (19\% in total numbers) but might have a wider impact on Web viewers, with the highest mean views/day (mean 39, SD 107) among four kinds of channels to distribute HTx-related information. Conclusions: YouTube videos on HTx benefit medical professionals by providing a substantial amount of information. However, it is a time-consuming course to find high-quality videos. More authoritative videos by trusted sources should be posted for dissemination of reliable information. With an improvement of ranking system and content providers in future, YouTube, as a freely accessible outlet, will help to meet the huge informational needs of medical staffs and promote medical education on HTx.},

	abstract = {Background: Approximately 300,000 people suffer sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) annually in the United States. Less than 30\% of out-of-hospital victims receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) despite the American Heart Association training over 12 million laypersons annually to conduct CPR. New engaging learning methods are needed for CPR education, especially in schools. Massively multiplayer virtual worlds (MMVW) offer platforms for serious games that are promising learning methods that take advantage of the computer capabilities of today?s youth (ie, the digital native generation). Objective: Our main aim was to assess the feasibility of cardiopulmonary resuscitation training in high school students by using avatars in MMVM. We also analyzed experiences, self-efficacy, and concentration in response to training. Methods: In this prospective international collaborative study, an e-learning method was used with high school students in Sweden and the United States. A software game platform was modified for use as a serious game to train in emergency medical situations. Using MMVW technology, participants in teams of 3 were engaged in virtual-world scenarios to learn how to treat victims suffering cardiac arrest. Short debriefings were carried out after each scenario. A total of 36 high school students (Sweden, n=12; United States, n=24) participated. Their self-efficacy and concentration (task motivation) were assessed. An exit questionnaire was used to solicit experiences and attitudes toward this type of training. Among the Swedish students, a follow-up was carried out after 6 months. Depending on the distributions, t tests or Mann-Whitney tests were used. Correlation between variables was assessed by using Spearman rank correlation. Regression analyses were used for time-dependent variables. Results: The participants enjoyed the training and reported a self-perceived benefit as a consequence of training. The mean rating for self-efficacy increased from 5.8/7 (SD 0.72) to 6.5/7 (SD 0.57, P{\textless}.001). In the Swedish follow-up, it subsequently increased from 5.7/7 (SD 0.56) to 6.3/7 (SD 0.38, P=.006). In the Swedish group, the mean concentration value increased from 52.4/100 (SD 9.8) to 62.7/100 (SD 8.9, P=.05); in the US group, the concentration value increased from 70.8/100 (SD 7.9) to 82.5/100 (SD 4.7, P{\textless}.001). We found a significant positive correlation (P{\textless}.001) between self-efficacy and concentration scores. Overall, the participants were moderately or highly immersed and the software was easy to use. Conclusions: By using online MMVWs, team training in CPR is feasible and reliable for this international group of high school students (Sweden and United States). A high level of appreciation was reported among these adolescents and their self-efficacy increased significantly. The described training is a novel and interesting way to learn CPR teamwork, and in the future could be combined with psychomotor skills training.},

	abstract = {Background: Demographic changes over the past decades call for the promotion of health and disease prevention for older patients, as well as strategies to enhance their independence, productivity, and quality of life. Objective: Our objective was to examine the effects of a computer-based educational intervention designed for general practitioners (GPs) to promote active aging. Methods: The Promoting Active Aging (PRACTA) study consisted of a baseline questionnaire, implementation of an intervention, and a follow-up questionnaire that was administered 1 month after the intervention. A total of 151 primary care facilities (response rate 151/767, 19.7\%) and 503 GPs (response rate 503/996, 50.5\%) agreed to participate in the baseline assessment. At the follow-up, 393 GPs filled in the questionnaires (response rate, 393/503, 78.1\%), but not all of them took part in the intervention. The final study group of 225 GPs participated in 3 study conditions: e-learning (knowledge plus skills modelling, n=42), a pdf article (knowledge only, n=89), and control (no intervention, n=94). We measured the outcome as scores on the Patients Expectations Scale, Communication Scale, Attitude Toward Treatment and Health Scale, and Self-Efficacy Scale. Results: GPs participating in e-learning demonstrated a significant rise in their perception of older patients? expectations for disease explanation (Wald ?2=19.7, P{\textless}.001) and in perception of motivational aspect of older patients? attitude toward treatment and health (Wald ?2=8.9, P=.03) in comparison with both the control and pdf article groups. We observed additional between-group differences at the level of statistical trend. GPs participating in the pdf article intervention demonstrated a decline in self-assessed communication, both at the level of global scoring (Wald ?2=34.5, P{\textless}.001) and at the level of 20 of 26 specific behaviors (all P{\textless}.05). Factors moderating the effects of the intervention were the number of patients per GP and the facility?s organizational structure. Conclusions: Both methods were suitable, but in different areas and under different conditions. The key benefit of the pdf article intervention was raising doctors? reflection on limitations in their communication skills, whereas e-learning was more effective in changing their perception of older patients? proactive attitude, especially among GPs working in privately owned facilities and having a greater number of assigned patients. Although we did not achieve all expected effects of the PRACTA intervention, both its forms seem promising in terms of enhancing the competencies of doctors in communication with and activation of older patients.},

	abstract = {Background: Primary health care workers (PHCWs) are a major force in delivering basic public health services (BPHS) in rural China. It is necessary to take effective training approaches to improve PHCWs? competency on BPHS. Both electronic learning (e-learning) and blended learning have been widely used in the health workers? education. However, there is limited evidence on the effects of blended learning in comparison with pure e-learning. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a blended-learning approach for rural PHCWs in improving their knowledge about BPHS as well as training satisfaction in comparison with a pure e-learning approach. Methods: The study was conducted among PHCWs in 6 rural counties of Hubei Province, China, between August 2013 and April 2014. Three counties were randomly allocated blended-learning courses (29 township centers or 612 PHCWs?the experimental group), and three counties were allocated pure e-learning courses (31 township centers or 625 PHCWs?the control group). Three course modules were administered for 5 weeks, with assessments at baseline and postcourse. Primary outcomes were score changes in courses? knowledge. Secondary outcome was participant satisfaction (5-point Likert scale anchored between 1 [strongly agree] and 5 [strongly disagree]). Results: The experimental group had higher mean scores than the control group in knowledge achievement in three course modules: (1) module 1: 93.21 (95\% CI 92.49-93.93) in experimental group versus 88.29 (95\% CI 87.19-89.40) in the control group; adjusted difference, 4.92 (95\% CI 2.61-7.24; P{\textless}.001); (2) module 2: 94.05 (95\% CI 93.37-94.73) in the experimental group vs 90.22 (95\% CI 89.12-91.31) in the control group; adjusted difference, 3.67 (95\% CI 1.17-6.18; P=.004); (3) module 3: 93.88 (95\% CI 93.08-94.68) in the experimental group versus 89.09 (95\% CI 87.89-90.30) in control group; adjusted difference, 4.63 (95\% CI 2.12-7.14; P{\textless}.001). The participants in the experimental learning group gave more positive responses with the four issues than control group participants: (1) the increase of interest in learning, 1.85 (95\% CI 1.22-2.80; P=.003); (2) the increase of interaction with others, 1.77 (95\% CI 1.20-2.60; P=.004); (3) the satisfaction with learning experience, 1.78 (95\% CI 1.11-2.88; P=.02); and (4) achievement of learning objectives, 1.63 (95\% CI 1.08-2.48; P=.02). Conclusions: Among PHCWs in rural China, a blended-learning approach to BPHS training could result in a higher knowledge achievement and satisfaction level compared with a pure e-learning approach. The findings of the study will contribute knowledge to improve the competency of PHCWs in similar settings.},

	abstract = {Background: Zambia faces a severe shortage of health workers, particularly in rural areas. To tackle this shortage, the Medical Licentiate program was initiated at Chainama College of Health Sciences in the capital, Lusaka, in 2002. The objective of the program was to alleviate the shortage of human resources in curative care. On-the-job training is conducted in decentralized teaching hospitals throughout Zambia. However, the program faces significant challenges such as shortages of senior medical instructors and learning materials.
Objective: Our aim was to address these challenges by introducing a self-directed, e-learning platform with an offline tablet as part of a collaborative blended-learning intervention to supplement local teaching and training.
Methods: The pilot phase of the e-learning platform was evaluated using a mixed-methods approach with a convergent parallel design. Various methods were employed to test the data’s adequacy and potential for generating valid results. Methods included questionnaires according to the technology acceptance model and information system success model by DeLone and McLean, semistructured interviews, learner diaries, pretesting, the collection of usage data, exam results, demographics, and informal feedback. Outcome measures included usage, adoption, efficiency, acceptance, user-friendliness, and gained knowledge and skills.
Results: In total, 52 students and 17 medical instructors participated in the pilot evaluation. The questionnaire results showed a high acceptance of the technology ({\textgreater}80\%) and high agreement ({\textgreater}75\%) with the e-learning platform. Semistructured interview results showed an overall appreciation of the e-learning intervention, but the need for more e-learning materials. Respondents identified a need for multimedia materials that transfer skills such as medical procedure visualization and interactive exercises to practice procedural knowledge. The learning diaries identified the lack of specific learning materials and potential shortcomings of existing learning materials. However, students were satisfied with the current e-learning content. The majority of students used the e-learning platform offline on their tablets; online e-learning was underutilized.
Conclusions: The pilot phase of the tablet-based e-learning platform to support the self-directed learning intervention was well received and appreciated by students and medical instructors of Chainama College of Health Sciences. E-learning for knowledge acquisition appears to be adequate and feasible for this low-resource educational environment. Our evaluation results guide the further development of the full implementation of the e-learning platform in this educational setting. E-learning materials should reflect curriculum requirements, and additional multimedia and interactive content is needed, as well as improved integration and active participation from medical instructors in the e-learning processes.},

	abstract = {Background: The progressive use of e-learning in postgraduate medical education calls for useful quality indicators. Many evaluation tools exist. However, these are diversely used and their empirical foundation is often lacking. Objective: We aimed to identify an empirically founded set of quality indicators to set the bar for ?good enough? e-learning. Methods: We performed a Delphi procedure with a group of 13 international education experts and 10 experienced users of e-learning. The questionnaire started with 57 items. These items were the result of a previous literature review and focus group study performed with experts and users. Consensus was met when a rate of agreement of more than two-thirds was achieved. Results: In the first round, the participants accepted 37 items of the 57 as important, reached no consensus on 20, and added 15 new items. In the second round, we added the comments from the first round to the items on which there was no consensus and added the 15 new items. After this round, a total of 72 items were addressed and, of these, 37 items were accepted and 34 were rejected due to lack of consensus. Conclusions: This study produced a list of 37 items that can form the basis of an evaluation tool to evaluate postgraduate medical e-learning. This is, to our knowledge, the first time that quality indicators for postgraduate medical e-learning have been defined and validated. The next step is to create and validate an e-learning evaluation tool from these items.},

	abstract = {Background: Electronic learning (e-learning) through mobile technology represents a novel way to teach emergent otorhinolaryngology-head and neck surgery (ORL-HNS) disorders to undergraduate medical students. Whether a cognitive style of education combined with learning modules can impact learning outcomes and satisfaction in millennial medical students is unknown. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the impact of cognitive styles and learning modules using mobile e-learning on knowledge gain, competence gain, and satisfaction for emergent ORL-HNS disorders. Methods: This randomized controlled trial included 60 undergraduate medical students who were novices in ORL-HNS at an academic teaching hospital. The cognitive style of the participants was assessed using the group embedded figures test. The students were randomly assigned (1:1) to a novel interactive multimedia (IM) group and conventional Microsoft PowerPoint show (PPS) group matched by age, sex, and cognitive style. The content for the gamified IM module was derived from and corresponded to the textbook-based learning material of the PPS module (video lectures). The participants were unblinded and used fully automated courseware containing the IM or PPS module on a 7-inch tablet for 100 min. Knowledge and competence were assessed using multiple-choice questions and multimedia situation tests, respectively. Each participant also rated their global satisfaction. Results: All of the participants (median age 23 years, range 22-26 years; 36 males and 24 females) received the intended intervention after randomization. Overall, the participants had significant gains in knowledge (median 50\%, interquartile range [IQR]=17\%-80\%, P{\textless}.001) and competence (median 13\%, IQR=0\%-33\%, P=.006). There were no significant differences in knowledge gain (40\%, IQR=13\%-76\% vs 60\%, IQR=20\%-100\%, P=.42) and competence gain (0\%, IQR= ?21\% to 38\% vs 25\%, IQR=0\%-33\%, P=.16) between the IM and PPS groups. However, the IM group had a higher satisfaction score (8, IQR=6-9 vs 6, IQR=4-7, P=.01) compared with the PPS group. Using Friedman?s two-way nonparametric analysis of variance, cognitive styles (field-independent, field-intermediate, or field-dependent classification) and learning modules (IM or PPS) had significant effects on both knowledge gain (both adjusted P{\textless}.001) and satisfaction (both adjusted P{\textless}.001). Conclusions: Mobile e-learning is an effective modality to improve knowledge of emergent ORL-HNS in millennial undergraduate medical students. Our findings suggest the necessity of developing various modules for undergraduate medical students with different cognitive styles.

	abstract = {Background: E-Learning has taken a firm place in postgraduate medical education. Whereas 10 years ago it was promising, it now has a definite niche and is clearly here to stay. However, evaluating the effect of postgraduate medical e-learning (PGMeL) and improving upon it can be complicated. While the learning aims of e-learning are evaluated, there are no instruments to evaluate the instructional design of PGMeL. Such an evaluation instrument may be developed by following the Association for Medical Education in Europe (AMEE) 7-step process. The first 5 steps of this process were previously performed by literature reviews, focus group discussion, and an international Delphi study. Objective: This study will continue with steps 6 and 7 and answer the research question: Is a content-validated PGMeL evaluation survey useful, understandable, and of added value for creators of e-learning? Methods: There are five phases in this study: creating a survey from 37 items (phase A); testing readability and question interpretation (phase B); adjusting, rewriting, and translating surveys (phase C); gathering completed surveys from three PGMeL modules (phase D); and holding focus group discussions with the e-learning authors (phase E). Phase E was carried out by presenting the results of the evaluations from phase D, followed by a group discussion. There are four groups of participants in this study. Groups A and B are experienced end users of PGMeL and participated in phase B. Group C are users who undertook e-learning and were asked to complete the survey in phase D. Group D are the authors of the e-learning modules described above. Results: From a list of 36 items, we developed a postgraduate Medical E-Learning Evaluation Survey (MEES). Seven residents participated in the phase B group discussion: 4 items were interpreted differently, 3 were not readable, and 2 items were double. The items from phase B were rewritten and, after adjustment, understood correctly. The MEES was translated into Dutch and again pilot-tested. All items were clear and were understood correctly. The MEES version used for the evaluation contained 3 positive domains (motivation, learning enhancers, and real-world translation) and 2 negative domains (barriers and learning discouragers), with 36 items in those domains, 5 Likert scale questions of 1 to 10, and 5 open questions asking participants to give their own comments in each domain. Three e-learning modules were evaluated from July to November 2018. There were a total of 158 responses from a Dutch module, a European OB/GYN (obstetrics and gynecology) module, and a surgical module offered worldwide. Finally, 3 focus group discussions took place with a total of 10 participants. Usefulness was much appreciated, understandability was good, and added value was high. Four items needed additional explanation by the authors, and a Creators? Manual was written at their request. Conclusions: The MEES is the first survey to evaluate the instructional design of PGMeL and was constructed following all 7 steps of the AMEE. This study completes the design of the survey and shows its usefulness and added value to the authors. It finishes with a final, publicly available survey that includes a Creators? Manual. We briefly discuss the number of responses needed and conclude that more is better; in the end, however, one has to work with what is available. The next steps would be to see whether improvement can be measured by using the MEES and continue to work on the end understandability in different languages and cultural groups.},

	abstract = {Background: Digital education tools (e-learning, technology-enhanced learning) can be defined as any educational intervention that is electronically mediated. Decveloping and applying such tools and interventions for postgraduate medical professionals who work and learn after graduation can be called postgraduate medical digital education (PGMDE), which is increasingly being used and evaluated. However, evaluation has focused mainly on reaching the learning goals and little on the design. Design models for digital education (instructional design models) help educators create a digital education curriculum, but none have been aimed at PGMDE. Studies show the need for efficient, motivating, useful, and satisfactory digital education. Objective: Our objective was (1) to create an empirical instructional design model for PGMDE founded in evidence and theory, with postgraduate medical professionals who work and learn after graduation as the target audience, and (2) to compare our model with existing models used to evaluate and create PGMDE. Methods: Previously we performed an integrative literature review, focus group discussions, and a Delphi procedure to determine which building blocks for such a model would be relevant according to experts and users. This resulted in 37 relevant items. We then used those 37 items and arranged them into chronological steps. After we created the initial 9-step plan, we compared these steps with other models reported in the literature. Results: The final 9 steps were (1) describe who, why, what, (2) select educational strategies, (3) translate to the real world, (4) choose the technology, (5) complete the team, (6) plan the budget, (7) plan the timing and timeline, (8) implement the project, and (9) evaluate continuously. On comparing this 9-step model with other models, we found that no other was as complete, nor were any of the other models aimed at PGMDE. Conclusions: Our 9-step model is the first, to our knowledge, to be based on evidence and theory building blocks aimed at PGMDE. We have described a complete set of evidence-based steps, expanding a 3-domain model (motivate, learn, and apply) to an instructional design model that can help every educator in creating efficient, motivating, useful, and satisfactory PGMDE. Although certain steps are more robust and have a deeper theoretical background in current research (such as education), others (such as budget) have been barely touched upon and should be investigated more thoroughly in order that proper guidelines may also be provided for them.},

	abstract = {Background: There is a need for evidence-based substance use prevention efforts that target high school-aged youth that are easy to implement and suitable for dissemination in school and community groups. The Youth Message Development (YMD) program is a brief, four-lesson, in-person curriculum that aims to prevent youth substance use through the development of youth media literacy. Specifically, YMD aims to increase understanding of advertising reach and costs, along with the techniques used to sell products; develop counterarguing and critical thinking skills in response to advertisements; and facilitate application of these skills to the development of youth-generated antisubstance messages. Although YMD has demonstrated evidence of success, it is limited by its delivery method and focus on alcohol and smoking. Objective: Study objectives were two-fold: (1) to adapt the YMD curriculum to a self-paced, interactive, electronic-learning (e-learning) format and expand its content to cover alcohol, combustible cigarettes, e-cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, marijuana, and prescription drugs, and (2) to test the feasibility of the adapted curriculum in partnership with a national youth organization. Methods: An iterative process was employed in partnership with the 4-H youth development organization and a technology developer and consisted of six phases: (1) focus groups to guide adaptation, (2) adaptation to an e-learning format renamed REAL media, (3) pilot-testing of the REAL media prototype to determine feasibility and acceptability, (4) program revisions, (5) usability testing of the revised prototype, and (6) final revisions. Focus groups and pilot and usability testing were conducted with 4-H youth club members and adult club leaders. Results: Focus group feedback guided the build of an e-learning prototype of REAL media, which consisted of five online levels and interactive content guided by a mix of narration and on-screen text. Results of a pilot test of the prototype were neutral to positive, and the program was refined based on end-user feedback. An independent usability test indicated that youth 4-H members felt favorably about navigating REAL media, and they reported high self-efficacy in applying skills learned in the program. Additional refinements to the program were made based on their feedback. Conclusions: The iterative build process involving the end user from the outset yielded an overall successful technology-driven adaptation of an evidence-based curriculum. This should increase the likelihood of effectively impacting behavioral outcomes as well as uptake within community organizations.},

	abstract = {Background: E-learning is rapidly growing as an alternative way of delivering education in nursing. Two contexts regarding the use of e-learning in nursing are discussed in the literature: (1) education among nursing students and (2) nurses? continuing education within a life-long learning perspective. A systematic review of systematic reviews on e-learning for nursing and health professional students in an academic context has been published previously; however, no such review exists regarding e-learning for registered nurses in a continuing education context. Objective: We aimed to systematically summarize the qualitative and quantitative evidence regarding the effects of e-learning on nursing care among nurses in a continuing education context. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of systematic qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-studies reviews, searching within four bibliographic databases. The eligibility criteria were formulated using the population, interventions, comparisons, outcomes, and study design (PICOS) format. The included population was registered nurses. E-learning interventions were included and compared with face-to-face and any other e-learning interventions, as well as blended learning. The outcomes of interest were derived from two models: nursing-sensitive indicators from the Nursing Care Performance Framework (eg, teaching and collaboration) and the levels of evaluation from the Kirkpatrick model (ie, reaction, learning, behavior, and results). Results: We identified a total of 12,906 records. We retrieved 222 full-text papers for detailed evaluation, from which 22 systematic reviews published between 2008 and 2018 met the eligibility criteria. The effects of e-learning on nursing care were grouped under Kirkpatrick?s levels of evaluation: (1) nurse reactions to e-learning, (2) nurse learning, (3) behavior, and (4) results. Level 2, nurse learning, was divided into three subthemes: knowledge, skills, attitude and self-efficacy. Level 4, results, was divided into patient outcomes and costs. Most of the outcomes were reported in a positive way. For instance, nurses were satisfied with the use of e-learning and they improved their knowledge. The most common topics covered by the e-learning interventions were medication calculation, preparation, and administration. Conclusions: The effects of e-learning are mainly reported in terms of nurse reactions, knowledge, and skills (ie, the first two levels of the Kirkpatrick model). The effectiveness of e-learning interventions for nurses in a continuing education context remains unknown regarding how the learning can be transferred to change practice and affect patient outcomes. Further scientific, methodological, theoretical, and practice-based breakthroughs are needed in the fast-growing field of e-learning in nursing education, especially in a life-learning perspective.

	abstract = {Background: Prompt and accurate identification of stroke victims is essential to reduce time from symptom onset to adequate treatment and to improve neurological outcomes. Most neurologists evaluate the extent of neurological deficit according to the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), but the use of this scale by paramedics, the first healthcare providers to usually take care of stroke victims, has proven unreliable. This might be, at least in part, due to the teaching method. The video used to teach NIHSS lacks interactivity, while more engaging electronic learning (e-learning) methods might improve knowledge acquisition. Objective: This study was designed to evaluate whether a highly interactive e-learning module could enhance NIHSS knowledge acquisition in paramedics. Methods: A randomized controlled trial comparing a specially designed e-learning module with the original NIHSS video was performed with paramedics working in Geneva, Switzerland. A registration number was not required as our study does not come into the scope of the Swiss federal law on human research. The protocol was nevertheless submitted to the local ethics committee (Project ID 2017-00847), which issued a ?Declaration of no objection.? Paramedics were excluded if they had prior knowledge of or previous training in the NIHSS, or if they had worked in a neurology or neurosurgery ward. The primary outcome was overall performance in the study quiz, which contained 50 questions. Secondary outcomes were performance by NIHSS item, time to course and quiz completion, user satisfaction regarding the learning method, user perception of the course duration, and probability the user would recommend the course to a colleague. Results: The study was completed by 39 paramedics. There was a better overall median score (36/50 vs 33/50, P=.04) and a higher degree of satisfaction regarding the learning method in the e-learning group (90\% vs 37\%, P=.002). Users who had followed the e-learning module were more likely to recommend the course to a colleague (95\% vs 63\%, P=.02). Paramedics in the e-learning group took more time to complete the course (93 vs 59 minutes, P{\textless}.001), but considered the duration to be more adequate (75\% vs 32\%, P=.01). Time to quiz completion was similar between groups (25 vs 38 minutes, P=.12). Conclusions: Use of an e-learning module shows promising results in teaching the NIHSS to paramedics.},

	abstract = {Background: Endoscopic examination is a popular and routine procedure for the diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. Skilled endoscopists are in great demand in clinical practice, but the training process for beginners to become endoscopy specialists is fairly long. Convenience and a self-paced, learner-centered approach make electronic learning (e-learning) an excellent instructional prospect. Objective: This study aimed to develop and apply an e-learning system in gastroscopy teaching and learning and to evaluate its effectiveness and user satisfaction. Methods: The e-learning software Gastroscope Roaming System was developed for primary learners. The system simulates the real structure of the upper gastrointestinal (UGI) tract to teach the main characteristics of gastroscopy under both normal conditions and conditions of common UGI tract diseases. A randomized controlled trial was conducted. Participants were randomly allocated to an e-learning group (EG)or a non?e-learning control group after a pretest. On completing the training, participants undertook a posttest and gastroscopy examination. In addition, the EG completed a satisfaction questionnaire. Results: Of the 44 volunteers, 41 (93\%) completed the gastroscopy learning and testing components. No significant pretest differences were found between the intervention and control groups (mean 50.86, SD 6.12 vs mean 50.76, SD 6.88; P=.96). After 1 month of learning, the EG?s posttest scores were higher (mean 83.70, SD 5.99 vs mean 78.76, SD 7.58; P=.03) and improved more (P=.01) than those of the control group, with better performance in the gastroscopy examination (mean 91.05, SD 4.58 vs mean 84.38, SD 5.19; P{\textless}.001). Overall, 85\% (17/20) of the participants were satisfied with the e-learning system, and 95\% (19/20) of the participants considered it successful. Conclusions: E-learning is an effective educational strategy for primary learners to acquire skills in gastroscopy examination and endoscopic imaging of the GI tract.

Objective: This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of an electronic learning (e-learning) module on the adherence to suicide prevention guidelines, knowledge of practical skills, and provider?s confidence to have a conversation about suicidal behavior with undergraduate psychology students. Methods: The e-learning module, comprising video recordings of therapist-patient interactions, was designed with the aim of transferring knowledge about suicide prevention guideline recommendations. The program?s effects on guideline adherence, self-evaluated knowledge, and provider?s confidence were assessed using online questionnaires before the program (baseline and at 1 month [T1] and 3 months after baseline). The eligible third- and fourth-year undergraduate psychology students were randomly allocated to the e-learning (n=211) or to a waitlist control condition (n=187), with access to the intervention after T1. Results: Overall, the students evaluated e-learning in a fairly positive manner. The intention-to-treat analysis showed that the students in the intervention condition (n=211) reported higher levels of self-evaluated knowledge, provider?s confidence, and guideline adherence than those in the waitlist control condition (n=187) after receiving the e-learning module (all P values{\textless}.001). When comparing the scores at the 1- and 3-month follow-up, after both groups had received access to the e-learning module, the completers-only analysis showed that the levels of knowledge, guideline adherence, and confidence remained constant (all P values{\textgreater}.05) within the intervention group, whereas a significant improvement was observed in the waitlist control group (all P values{\textless}.05). Conclusions: An e-learning intervention on suicide prevention could be an effective first step toward improved knowledge of clinical skills. The learning outcomes of a stand-alone module were found to be similar to those of a training that combined e-learning with a face-to-face training, with the advantages of flexibility and low costs.},

              Hintergrund
              Die Corona-Krise beeinflusst nicht nur das professionelle Handeln, sondern auch die Lehre an den Universitäten. Schlagworte wie „E-Learning“ und „Digitalisierung“ suggerieren die Möglichkeit innovativer, ad hoc verfügbarer Lösungsansätze für die Lehre in der aktuellen COVID-19-Situation. Die aktuelle Umstellung auf digitale Lehre ist aber nicht primär durch eine didaktische Sinnhaftigkeit oder institutionelle Strategie, sondern durch äußere Notwendigkeit geprägt.
            
            
              Ziel der Arbeit
              Ziel der Arbeit war die Erfassung der Lehrsituation an nationalen Universitäts-HNO-Kliniken und akademischen Lehrkrankenhäusern zu Beginn des virtuellen Corona-Sommersemesters 2020.
            
            
              Material und Methode
              Ein eigens erstellter Fragebogen zur jeweiligen lokalen Situation, den örtlichen Rahmenbedingungen sowie zu bundesweiten Szenarien wurde an alle 39 nationalen Universitäts-HNO-Kliniken und 20 akademischen Lehrkrankenhäuser mit HNO-Hauptabteilung versandt.
            
            
              Ergebnisse
              Die ausgefüllten Fragebögen von 31 Universitätskliniken (UK) und 10 akademische Lehrkrankenhäuser (ALK) gingen in die Auswertung ein. Es zeigten sich offensichtliche Diskrepanzen zwischen verfügbaren Ressourcen und tatsächlich verfügbaren digitalisierten Lehrinhalten. Weitere Kritikpunkte offenbarten sich in Bezug auf die Kommunikation mit der Medizinischen Fakultät, die digitale Infrastruktur und insbesondere in der oftmals mangelnden Kollaboration mit den zentralen Supportstrukturen, wie Medien‑, Didaktik- und Rechenzentren.
            
            
              Schlussfolgerung
              Es gibt durchaus positive Beispiele für eine gelungene Überführung der Präsenzlehre in das ausschließlich virtuelle Sommersemester 2020 innerhalb der Universitäts-HNO-Kliniken. Mehrheitlich aber überwiegen kritische Einschätzungen der Lehrbeauftragten bzw. Ärztlichen Direktoren gegenüber der aktuellen Lehrsituation. Eine zeitkritische strategische Weiterentwicklung ist dringend erforderlich.

            Abstract
            
              Background
              The corona crisis not only affects professional activities but also teaching and learning at universities. Buzzwords, such as e‑learning and digitalization suggest the possibility of innovative teaching approaches that are readily available to solve the problems of teaching in the current COVID-19 pandemic. The current conversion to digital teaching is not primarily driven by didactic rationale or institutional strategy but by external circumstances.
            
            
              Objective
              The aim of the study was to determine the teaching situation at national university ENT clinics and academic teaching hospitals at the start of the virtual corona summer semester in 2020.
            
            
              Material and methods
              A specifically self-designed questionnaire regarding the local situation and conditions as well as nationwide scenarios was sent to all 39 national university ENT clinics and 20 ENT departments at academic teaching hospitals.
            
            
              Results
              A total of 31 university hospitals and 10 academic teaching hospitals took part in the survey. There were obvious discrepancies between available resources and effectively available digital teaching and learning contents. Further criticism was expressed regarding the communication with the medical faculty, the digital infrastructure and particularly the frequent lack of collaboration with central support facilities, such as media, didactics and datacenters.
            
            
              Conclusion
              There are positive examples of successful transformation of classroom teaching to an exclusively virtual summer semester 2020 within the university ENT clinics; however, critical ratings of assistant professors and medical directors regarding the current teaching situation predominated. A time-critical strategic advancement is urgently needed.},

	abstract = {Background: Blended learning, which combines face-to-face learning and e-learning, has grown rapidly to be commonly used in education. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of this learning approach has not been completely quantitatively synthesized and evaluated using knowledge outcomes in health education. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of blended learning compared to that of traditional learning in health education. Methods: We performed a systematic review of blended learning in health education in MEDLINE from January 1990 to July 2019. We independently selected studies, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and compared overall blended learning versus traditional learning, offline blended learning versus traditional learning, online blended learning versus traditional learning, digital blended learning versus traditional learning, computer-aided instruction blended learning versus traditional learning, and virtual patient blended learning versus traditional learning. All pooled analyses were based on random-effect models, and the I2 statistic was used to quantify heterogeneity across studies. Results: A total of 56 studies (N=9943 participants) assessing several types of learning support in blended learning met our inclusion criteria; 3 studies investigated offline support, 7 studies investigated digital support, 34 studies investigated online support, 8 studies investigated computer-assisted instruction support, and 5 studies used virtual patient support for blended learning. The pooled analysis comparing all blended learning to traditional learning showed significantly better knowledge outcomes for blended learning (standardized mean difference 1.07, 95\% CI 0.85 to 1.28, I2=94.3\%). Similar results were observed for online (standardized mean difference 0.73, 95\% CI 0.60 to 0.86, I2=94.9\%), computer-assisted instruction (standardized mean difference 1.13, 95\% CI 0.47 to 1.79, I2=78.0\%), and virtual patient (standardized mean difference 0.62, 95\% CI 0.18 to 1.06, I2=78.4\%) learning support, but results for offline learning support (standardized mean difference 0.08, 95\% CI ?0.63 to 0.79, I2=87.9\%) and digital learning support (standardized mean difference 0.04, 95\% CI ?0.45 to 0.52, I2=93.4\%) were not significant. Conclusions: From this review, blended learning demonstrated consistently better effects on knowledge outcomes when compared with traditional learning in health education. Further studies are needed to confirm these results and to explore the utility of different design variants of blended learning.},

	abstract = {Background: Continual development of the social care workforce is a key element in improving outcomes for the users of social care services. As the delivery of social care services continues to benefit from innovation in assistive technologies, it is important that the digital capabilities of the social care workforce are aligned. Policy makers have highlighted the importance of using technology to support workforce learning and development, and the need to ensure that the workforce has the necessary digital skills to fully benefit from such provisions. Objective: This study aims to identify the digital capability of the social care workforce in Northern Ireland and to explore the workforce?s appetite for and barriers to using technology for learning and development. This study is designed to answer the following research questions: (1) What is the digital capability of the social care workforce in Northern Ireland? (2) What is the workforce?s appetite to participate in digital learning and development? and (3) If there are barriers to the uptake of technology for learning and development, what are these barriers? Methods: A survey was created and distributed to the Northern Ireland social care workforce. This survey collected data on 127 metrics that described demographics, basic digital skills, technology confidence and access, factors that influence learning and development, experience with digital learning solutions, and perceived value and challenges of using technology for learning. Results: The survey was opened from December 13, 2018, to January 18, 2019. A total of 775 survey respondents completed the survey. The results indicated a workforce with a high level of self-reported basic digital skills and confidence. Face-to-face delivery of learning is still the most common method of accessing learning, which was used by 83.7\% (649/775) of the respondents; however, this is closely followed by digital learning, which was used by 79.0\% (612/775) of the respondents. There was a negative correlation between age and digital skills (rs=?0.262; P{\textless}.001), and a positive correlation between technology confidence and digital skills (rs=0.482; P{\textless}.001). There was also a negative correlation between age and the perceived value of technology (rs=?0.088; P=.02). The results indicated a predominantly motivated workforce in which a sizable portion is already engaged in informal digital learning. The results indicated that lower self-reported basic digital skills and confidence were associated with less interest in engaging with e-learning tools and that a portion of the workforce would benefit from additional basic digital skills training. Conclusions: These promising results provide a positive outlook for the potential of digital learning and development within the social care workforce. The findings provide clear areas of focus for the future use of technology for learning and development of the social care workforce and considerations to maximize engagement with such approaches.},

The aim of the present study is the investigation of time perspectives as the predictors of online self-regulated learning. In our study 210 Transylvanian students participated, from the Babeș-Bolyai University, Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences. Students’ demographic characteristics were recorded, for the assessment of self-regulation the Self-regulated Online Learning Questionnaire - Revised was applied and time perspectives of students were measured by the Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory. A correlational, cross-sectional design was used. On the basis of the results of hierarchical regression, in our first model demographic characteristics explained 5\% of the variance for the application of selfregulation activities. In our second model, controlling demographic variables, time perspectives explained an additional 33\% of the variance for self-regulation. Self-regulated learning strategies are predicted among demographic characteristics by students’ gender, age and online learning, while out of time perspectives only future orientation proved to be a significant predictor. Females, older students, participants attending online education and higher future orientation apply to a higher degree the selfregulated learning strategies as males, younger students and participants with lower scores at future orientation.},

The tumor-stroma ratio (TSR) was previously validated by international research groups as a robust parameter with good interobserver agreement. Objective: The Uniform Noting for International Application of the Tumor-Stroma Ratio as an Easy Diagnostic Tool (UNITED) study was developed to bring the TSR to clinical implementation. As part of the study, an e-Learning module was constructed to confirm the reproducibility of scoring the TSR after proper instruction. Methods: The e-Learning module consists of an autoinstruction for TSR determination (instruction video or written protocol) and three sets of 40 cases (training, test, and repetition sets). Scoring the TSR is performed on hematoxylin and eosin?stained sections and takes only 1-2 minutes. Cases are considered stroma-low if the amount of stroma is ?50\%, whereas a stroma-high case is defined as {\textgreater}50\% stroma. Inter- and intraobserver agreements were determined based on the Cohen ? score after each set to evaluate the reproducibility. Results: Pathologists and pathology residents (N=63) with special interest in colorectal cancer participated in the e-Learning. Forty-nine participants started the e-Learning and 31 (63\%) finished the whole cycle (3 sets). A significant improvement was observed from the training set to the test set; the median ? score improved from 0.72 to 0.77 (P=.002). Conclusions: e-Learning is an effective method to instruct pathologists and pathology residents for scoring the TSR. The reliability of scoring improved from the training to the test set and did not fall back with the repetition set, confirming the reproducibility of the TSR scoring method.

	abstract = {Background: Nephrotic syndrome is a unique clinical disorder, which provides interesting teaching opportunities that connect physiological and pathological aspects to clinical practice. During the current COVID-19 outbreak, in-person teaching in our institution was not permitted, thus creating a unique challenge for clinical skills teaching. A case-based electronic learning (e-learning) activity was designed to replace the traditional in-person teaching of renal semiology. e-Learning activities have been shown to be effective for knowledge retention and increasing novice learners’ performance. However, major knowledge gaps exist concerning the satisfaction of learners with e-learning activities as the sole form of teaching, specifically for undergraduate clinical skills education.
Objective: Our study aimed to prospectively assess undergraduate medical students’ perceptions of and satisfaction with an e-learning activity teaching renal semiology.
Methods: All second-year medical students (novice learners) from the medical faculty of the University of Geneva, Switzerland, undertook the e-learning activity and were invited to participate in a nonmandatory, validated web-based survey, comprising questions answered using a 10-point Likert scale and one qualitative open-ended question. For comparison and to provide further insights, 17 fourth- to sixth-year students (advanced learners) were prospectively recruited to participate in both the e-learning activity and the evaluation. A mixed methods analysis was performed.
Results: A total of 88 (63\%) out of 141 novice learners and all advanced learners responded to the evaluation survey. Advanced learners reported significantly higher satisfaction with the e-learning activity (mean 8.7, SD 1.0 vs mean 7.3, SD 1.8; P{\textless}.001), clarity of objectives (mean 9.6, SD 0.8 vs mean 7.7, SD 1.7; P{\textless}.001), and attainability of objectives (mean 9.8, SD 0.5 vs mean 7.3, SD 1.3; P{\textless}.001). Both groups showed high interest in the inclusion of the activity as part of a blended learning approach; however, there was low interest in the activity being the sole means of teaching.
Conclusions: Case-based e-learning activities might be better suited for advanced learners and could increase learners’ satisfaction within a blended teaching instructional design. More research on students’ satisfaction with e-learning activities in the field of clinical skills education should be done. In addition, more effort should be put into finding alternative teaching tools for clinical skills education in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and future health crises.},

              Hintergrund
              Im Verlauf der COVID-19-Pandemie haben offizielle Schutzmaßnahmen traditionelle Präsenzfortbildungen zum Erliegen gebracht. Für das Fach Orthopädie und Unfallchirurgie (O\&U) gibt es bisher bezüglich der Angebots- und Nachfragesituation von E‑Learning per Webinar im Kontext der COVID-19-Pandemie keine belastbaren Zahlen.
            
            
              Fragestellung
              Das Ziel der vorliegenden Arbeit ist die quantitative Beschreibung von Angebot und Nachfrage deutschsprachiger Online-Fortbildungen mit Webinar-Charakter aus der Orthopädie und Unfallchirurgie (O\&U) im zeitlichen Zusammenhang mit der COVID-19-Pandemie.
            
            
              Material und Methoden
              Über gängige Suchmaschinen wurden deutschsprachige, nichtkommerzielle, editierte und wissenschaftlich fundierte Fortbildungen in Form von Webinaren im Bereich O\&U von Anbietern mit Sitz in Deutschland identifiziert und interviewt.
            
            
              Ergebnisse
              Alle 4 eingeschlossenen Anbieter (AO Online Campus, BVOU Study Club, OU TO GO, WebDGU) nahmen an den strukturierten Interviews teil und stimmten einer Offenlegung der Teilnehmerzahlen zu. Das Angebot von Webinaren stieg im zeitlichen Zusammenhang mit der COVID-19-Pandemie an. Ebenfalls erhöhten sich bei allen 4 Anbietern die Teilnehmerzahlen.
            
            
              Diskussion
              Während OU TO GO und der BVOU Study Club bereits vor der Pandemie auf E‑Learning-Formate spezialisiert waren, wurde das Kursangebot der AO durch den neu etablierten AO online Campus erweitert und WebDGU ganz neu konzipiert. Eine Limitation der Studie ist die exklusive Ausrichtung auf Webinare und nichtkommerzielle Anbieter. Die Ergebnisse lassen auf positive Entwicklungen in O\&U im Bereich E‑Learning hoffen.

              This research study was established to collect facts and figures about webinars as a representative part of e‑learning in the subject of orthopedics and trauma surgery in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
            
            
              Material and methods
              German-speaking non-commercial and edited webinars, produced by suppliers from Germany were identified using common search engines. Structured interviews with questionnaires about provider, format, and number of participants in the webinars over time, were offered to the operating companies.
            
            
              Results
              The study included four suppliers of webinars (AO Online Campus, BVOU Study Club, OU TO GO and WebDGU). There was approval of all operating companies to participate in the interviews and to disclose facts and figures about their webinars. All suppliers showed an increased supply and demand for webinars during the COVID-19 pandemic.
            
            
              Discussion
              OU TO GO and BVOU Study Club already offered webinars prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. AO online Campus was designed in addition to the existing portfolio. The supply of WebDGU was newly established. Limitations of this study are the exclusion of commercial suppliers, non-German operating companies and all other types of e‑learning except webinars. The increased supply and demand for webinars during the COVID-19 pandemic gives hope for further improvement of e‑learning in the subject of orthopedics and trauma surgery.},

            Abstract
            
              Background
              German university otorhinolaryngology has a need for digital teaching content. Case-based e‑learning represents a digital teaching methodology. The data on student use of case-based e‑learning in university teaching of ENT medicine are limited.
            
            
              Objective
              The aim of this work was to determine the extent to which voluntary case-based e‑learning is used by otolaryngology students and what influence the quality of the e‑learning has on motivation to use e‑learning and on the interest in otolaryngology.
            
            
              Materials and methods
              Fifteen voluntary e‑learning cases were created based on the content of the ENT lecture in the winter semester 2022/2023. Subsequently, a descriptive evaluation of the usage statistics of the cases of 157 students was conducted. Likewise, an evaluation of the quality of the e‑learning as well as the motivation to complete it and the interest in otorhinolaryngology was carried out using a voluntary questionnaire.
            
            
              Results
              Voluntary case-based e‑learning was used to varying degrees by 66\% of the students. The quality of e‑learning correlated significantly with the motivation and the interest in otolaryngology.
            
            
              Conclusion
              The teaching content of otorhinolaryngology can be implemented sufficiently in case-based e‑learning and is characterized by satisfactory student acceptance. Integration should be accomplished in a high-quality manner to increase motivation and interest in otorhinolaryngology.},

Traditional electronic learning (e-learning) platforms have long served as a cornerstone in radiology education, offering rich visual content, interactive sessions, and peer-reviewed materials. They excel in teaching intricate concepts and techniques that necessitate visual aids, such as image interpretation and procedural demonstrations. However, Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT), an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered language model, has made its mark in radiology education. It can generate learning assessments, create lesson plans, act as a round-the-clock virtual tutor, enhance critical thinking, translate materials for broader accessibility, summarize vast amounts of information, and provide real-time feedback for any subject, including radiology. Concerns have arisen regarding ChatGPT's data accuracy, currency, and potential biases, especially in specialized fields such as radiology. However, the quality, accessibility, and currency of e-learning content can also be imperfect. To enhance the educational journey for radiology residents, the integration of ChatGPT with expert-curated e-learning resources is imperative for ensuring accuracy and reliability and addressing ethical concerns. While AI is unlikely to entirely supplant traditional radiology study methods, the synergistic combination of AI with traditional e-learning can create a holistic educational experience.},

	abstract = {Background:  Digital learning is a rapidly advancing method for teaching and learning in professional health educa‑tion. Although various digital learning designs have been tried in OT education, studies on digital learning designs are still limited.
Methods:  We conducted a scoping study that aimed to identify the digital learning designs used in occupational therapy (OT) education and review the effectiveness, learner perceptions, clinical skills integrated, and technologybased learning strategies used to facilitate learning. Four databases were searched using subheadings and terms relating to digital learning, occupational therapy, and education. The included studies were mapped according to the types of digital learning design, subjects, key clinical skills, and outcomes.
Results:  Twenty-two studies were included in this review, most of which were qualitative, observational, or mixed studies of the two designs. The digital learning designs identified in OT education were flipped, blended, hybrid, and distance learning, including e-learning and massive open online courses (MOOC). Among the components of clinical skills, professional reasoning and procedural knowledge were the most integrated into digital learning, and covered various OT subjects. Digital learning designs were reported to be equivalent to or more effective than the traditional face-to-face (F2F) class in learning outcomes of knowledge and skill acquisition, enhancing learning participation, reflection, and collaboration between learners. Various technologies have been used to promote synchronous or asynchronous active learning, providing learning strategies such as thinking, reflection, discussion, peer learninggroup activity, and gamifying online learning.
Conclusions:  In OT digital learning, appropriate learning subjects, the arrangement of clinical skill components that can be well integrated into digital learning, and the selection of appropriate technologies for effective learning are important. The results should be confirmed within an experimental study design.},

	abstract = {Currently, primary and secondary school education quality is a major source of concern for educators. A significant number of factors, such as the development of scientific and technological progress, technological innovations, and digitalization, affect the quality of education. In recent years, teachers have come to believe that the textbook they choose has a big influence on their students’ academic performance. To determine the difficulties of selecting e-learning materials for primary school students, a quasi-experimental study was conducted. The challenge of choosing instructional materials was examined using the example of a teacher’s selection of a mathematics textbook. The purpose of the study was to determine the extent to which the teacher’s selection of an e-textbook for mathematics instruction affected the performance of fourth-grade students. The two selected test groups of the same size (140 students) included students from an elementary city school in Russia. The participants were nine years old on average. Participants in the second experimental group performed better on the final test (74.71) than those in the first (65.9), per ANCOVA analysis. There was a significant difference between the two groups’ test results (F = 10.84, p {\textless} 0.05). The findings demonstrated that primary school students’ performance levels can be significantly impacted by the choice of electronic textbooks to teach them. Additionally, the study indicated useful criteria for the selection of high-quality e-textbooks by teachers. These criteria allow educators to make a choice that may significantly influence the educational process. The findings of this study demonstrate that using e-textbook approval guidelines based on theoretically sound quality indicators can help prevent the use of subpar textbooks in classrooms and raise the standard of textbooks in general. The educational opportunities offered by primary school textbooks may also have an impact on students’ performances in higher grades.},

To indicate what are the needs for curriculum development in educational programmes, this study aims to provide an overview of how various health professionals are currently trained in health promotion and disease prevention at different educational levels.
Methods:  In 2019, a descriptive mapping exercise was performed focusing on European programmes for different health and healthcare professionals at the three levels of education (undergraduate, postgraduate, and continuous professional development [CPD]). Data were collected by a self-developed online survey that was distributed using a modified snowball method.
Results:  A total of 186 educational programmes of 17 different health professionals were analysed, implemented in 31 countries (60\% were undergraduate, 30\% postgraduate and 10\% CPD programmes). Nearly all programmes indicated that expected outcomes were defined on knowledge (99\%), skills (94\%) and behaviours/attitudes (89\%) regarding health promotion and disease prevention. A multidisciplinary approach was reported to be applied by 81\% of the programmes. Traditional teaching methods such as lectures (97\%) and assignments (81\%) were dominant, while e-learning was less frequently used (46\%). Digitalization in health promotion and digital health coaching were the least addressed topics in most programmes.
Conclusions:  Health promotion and disease prevention are reported at all surveyed levels of education for a broad spectrum of health professionals. Educational programmes cover contents on knowledge, skills, and behaviours. There is a need for capacity building and joint development in health promotion education. Specifically, there is a need to include digitalisation and novel teaching in the educational programmes of health promotion and disease prevention.},

	abstract = {Der Orientierungsrahmen Digitale Kompetenzen für das Lehramt in den Naturwissenschaften (kurz: DiKoLAN) ermöglicht das Ableiten von Curricula für die universitäre Phase der Lehrkräftebildung und bietet eine theoretische Hintergrundfolie für die Evaluierung der Kompetenzstände und Entwicklungsprozesse von Lehramtsstudierenden. An Hochschulen entsteht eine entsprechende Fülle an naturwissenschaftsdidaktisch begründeten Lehr-Lern-Szenarien und Unterrichtsideen für den Einsatz digitaler Medien, die praktizierende Lehrkräfte als Innovationsträger*innen von heute nicht in gleichem Maß erreicht. In den Projekten Methoden und Medien im Biologieunterricht (MuM) und Methoden des Biologieunterrichts digital umsetzen (MeBiDi) konnten angehende Biologielehrkräfte in hochschulischen Lehrveranstaltungen der Universitäten Kassel und Hamburg Erfahrungen mit digitalen Tools sammeln und erproben, wie sich darüber Methoden ihres Fachunterrichts digital umsetzen bzw. unterstützen lassen. Ihr Wissen und die dazugehörigen Umsetzungstipps gaben die Studierenden im Rahmen von Erklärvideos, Mikrofortbildungen und Praxisartikeln an praktizierende Biologielehrkräfte weiter. Hinter diesem didaktischen Konzept steht das Bildungsprogramm Service Learning (Lernen durch Engagement): Biologielehramtsstudierende verknüpfen ihr theoretisches Lernen an der Universität mit der Durchführung praktischer Projekte, die dem Gemeinwohl dienen. Zugleich bieten sie Praxispartner*innen aus dem Bereich Bildung eine Dienstleistung, die besonders in Zeiten von Distanz- und Hybridunterricht einem echten gesellschaftlichen Bedarf entsprach. In der hier präsentierten Studie wurden zwei Durchführungsvarianten eines digitalisierungsbezogenen Service-Learning-Seminars in einem Eingruppen-Pretest-Posttest-Design (N = 78 Biologielehramtsstudierende) mit quantitativen Forschungsmethoden untersucht. Bei beiden Studierendengruppen zeigen sich auf Ebene des Lernerfolgs positive Effekte auf selbsteingeschätzte Kompetenzen zum technologisch-pädagogischen Inhaltswissen, technologischen und technologisch-pädagogischen Wissen sowie zu unterrichtlichen Selbstwirksamkeitserwartungen.},

	abstract = {As a result of the pandemic, but also of the rapid advancement of technology in general, e-learning has emerged as a popular method of education, providing students with flexibility and accessibility. Understanding the factors that influence students’ levels of learning and accomplishment in this digital learning environment is therefore critical for teachers and institutions seeking to increase the effectiveness of teaching and knowledge transfer via e-learning platforms. A number of variables that might improve or impair student use, learning, and performance affect how successful e-learning actually is. In order to maximize the benefits of e-learning and guarantee successful student results, educators and policymakers must have a thorough understanding of these elements. The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of extrinsic and intrinsic factors on students’ use, learning level, and performance in the setting of e-learning in higher education in two countries. This study evaluates the impact of extrinsic elements such as course content, e-learning system quality, institutional and teacher support, as well as intrinsic aspects such as personal innovativeness, self-efficacy, and information sharing in two countries. The study takes a quantitative approach, and the analysis was carried out using the structural equations method to examine the combined influence of numerous extrinsic and intrinsic elements on the use of e-learning, as well as learning level and performance.The research results show that the course content and e-learning system, personal innovativeness, self-efficacy, and knowledge sharing have a positive influence on the intention to use e-learning. Also, the intention of using an e-learning system will increase the actual use of e-learning technologies, which will ultimately result in better learning performance. The findings of this study will help educators, policymakers, and e-learning platform developers create effective ways for optimizing student experiences and promoting good learning outcomes in higher education settings.},

	abstract = {Personalized education—the systematic adaptation of instruction to individual learners—has been a long-striven goal. We review research on personalized education that has been conducted in the laboratory, in the classroom, and in digital learning environments. Across all learning environments, we find that personalization is most successful when relevant learner characteristics are measured repeatedly during the learning process and when these data are used to adapt instruction in a systematic way. Building on these observations, we propose a novel, dynamic framework of personalization that conceptualizes learners as dynamic entities that change during and in interaction with the instructional process. As these dynamics manifest on different timescales, so do the opportunities for instructional adaptations—ranging from setting appropriate learning goals at the macroscale to reacting to affective-motivational fluctuations at the microscale. We argue that instructional design needs to take these dynamics into account in order to adapt to a specific learner at a specific point in time. Finally, we provide some examples of successful, dynamic adaptations and discuss future directions that arise from a dynamic conceptualization of personalization. (DIPF/Orig.)},

The transition from conventional to e-learning because of the Covid-19 pandemic significantly affects the readiness of lecturers and students to get involved in learning activities, which affects the development of the students' characters. This is a mixed method case study, conducted in seven university. Seven hundred forty-six students of public and private higher educations in Indonesia were investigated in this research. Data collected through observation, field journals and interviews. Data were analyzed through quantitatively and qualitatively. The result showed that the students' performance and collaboration characteristics were not as good as their spiritual character. The students did assignments without paying too much attention to the quality of the content. The students tended to finish the assignments independently, they were rarely involved in the discussion, felt the changing of the academic climate because of the difficulties in accessing the platform to fulfill the needs of remote interaction among the students. The lecturers' readiness was unfamiliar with the teaching platform, and they needed time for converting teaching material into digital form and gave them many assignments.},

	abstract = {Crucial for organizations’ business performance, 21st-century digital skills have gained prominence. The Covid-19 pandemic’s impact on individuals, education, and higher education institutions led to a shift from traditional face-to-face to remote synchronous learning. Students experienced diverse information and communication technologies (ICTs), while instructors adapted course structures, engaged in e-learning, and revamped online curricula. This study examines factors affecting students’ digital skills acquisition, including instructor involvement, e-course quality, e-learning system usability, and e-course interactivity. Additionally, we explore the relationship between increased educational ICT usage and improved digital skills. Drawing from a survey of 624 higher education students in Pristina, Kosovo, and employing variance-based PLS-SEM analysis using SmartPLS 3.0, we find that active professor engagement in e-learning significantly influences digital skills acquisition. Ease of use and e-course interactivity also wield substantial effects, while e-course quality indirectly affects digital skills. Enhanced educational ICT usage positively correlates with creative and innovative skills development, enabled by content creation and ICT integration. This study contributes to the ongoing discussion regarding the potential enhancement of digital skills acquisition among higher education students. The findings indicate that increasing students’ gaining digital skills through e-learning is indeed achievable through instructor involvement, e-course quality, ease of use, and increased ICT utilization. This study’s insights provide a foundation for educators, institutions, and policymakers to make informed decisions on designing effective e-learning environments and strategies that promote students’ digital skills in a rapidly evolving educational landscape.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Online Interaction is a critical characteristic of distance learning, and effective online communication models empower students.
PURPOSE: This research aimed to explain students' experiences on the quality of interpersonal interactions in e-learning.
METHOD: This study was conducted from November 2021 to October 2022. The qualitative descriptive design via conventional content analysis was utilized. Purposeful and maximum variation methods recruited sixteen participants from three medical science universities in Iran. The data were collected through semi-structured, in-depth, face-to-face, or online interviews. Interviews were recorded through a digital recorder, and analysis was achieved simultaneously with data collection using Graneheim and Lundman (2004). The Lincoln and Guba criteria, including credibility, dependability, transferability, and confirmability, were used to improve the trustworthiness of the findings.
RESULTS: The results indicated the importance of different dimensions related to teaching-learning. It seems crucial to develop a comfortable and safe environment to improve interpersonal interactions. Educators should be provided with pedagogical skills to support interactions. In addition, focusing on some learners' soft skills is also vital. In addition to the significance of the teacher's inclusive role, the educational content must have critical standards. Constructive feedback and the proper use of simultaneous and non-simultaneous communication tools and social networks are other important issues in strengthening interpersonal relationships. Ultimately, comprehensive and ongoing support of learners improves the quality of interpersonal interactions.
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated the significance of different dimensions of teaching-learning as facilitating factors of interpersonal interactions. The proper use of simultaneous and non-simultaneous communication tools and social networks are other important issues in strengthening interpersonal relationships. Ultimately, comprehensive and ongoing support of learners improves the quality of interpersonal interactions.
IMPLICATIONS: The results of this study give teachers the insight to keep essential issues in mind when developing their online courses and students to be aware of their roles in the online learning process. Also, the characteristics of simultaneous and non-synchronous platforms, social messaging networks, and learner support are crucial.},

In der Arbeitswelt wurde hierauf mit Konzepten wie der New Work (inkl. agile Projektarbeit, virtuelle Teams, Homeoffice, E-Learning etc.) reagiert. Entsprechend ändern sich auch die Perspektiven, Ziele, Settings, Prozesse und Resultate des Lernens in der beruflichen Bildung. So lassen sich hier zunehmend hybride Lernsysteme beobachten, bei denen formale Bildungssettings und Schulungen, Diskussionen mit Kolleg:innen, informelle Netzwerkaktivitäten, Online-Lernmodule, Coaching usw. kombiniert werden. Durch die immer umfassendere Unterstützung dieser Aktivitäten mit digitalen Systemen werden formale und informelle Lernprozesse sichtbar. Lernende können auf notwendiges Wissen weltweit zugreifen und erhalten Feedback, das ihnen nicht nur auf der individuellen Ebene hilft, ihre Aufgaben und Probleme zu bewältigen sowie sich persönlich weiterzuentwickeln, sondern auch hilft, auf der kollektiven Ebene gemeinsam neues Wissen, Prozesse, Artefakte etc. zu generieren, um Projekte, Institutionen und Netzwerke zu fördern. Im Rahmen dieses Beitrages stellen wir das ‚Expansive Lernen‘ von Engeström als einen exemplarischen Ansatz des Hybriden Expansivismus vor und illustrieren es anhand eines Szenarios zur Nachhaltigkeit im Lebensmittelbereich. Mit diesem Vorgehen nehmen wir explizit eine erweiterte Sichtweise auf Lehr- und Lerntheorien ein. Dabei soll die eher traditionelle und individualistisch geprägte Sichtweise um eine kollektivistische ergänzt werden. Eine solche scheint für die Bewältigung der durch Disruption ausgelösten Herausforderungen notwendig zu sein, da sie neue, innovative und kreative Konzeptbildungen und praktische Neugestaltungen ermöglicht, wobei Grenzen einzelner Disziplinen, Positionen oder Organisationen, aber auch traditioneller Selbstverständnisse und Regeln überschritten werden.},

METHODS: N = 126 third-year medical students who participated in the pre-post study were assigned to either the intervention groups (VM, VR, and VMR) or the wait-list control group. The efficacy of the three approaches was assessed by means of a situational judgment test (SJT) of medical communication competence. To investigate the differences between the wait-list control and the intervention groups (H1), between the single-mode and combined conditions (H2), and between VM and VR (H3), we applied planned contrast analyses.
RESULTS: The planned contrasts showed that the VR condition significantly improved learning outcomes in comparison to the VM condition (H3). The decreased mean scores of the VM condition offset the increased mean scores of VR, and thus no significant differences could be found in H1 and H2.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides promising evidence that VR fosters medical communication competence more effectively than VM.
PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Medical students' learning in video-based digital environments can be facilitated by the use of interactive VR.},

Die Tagung wurde zusätzlich unterstützt vom Regensburger Universitätszentrum für Lehrerbildung RUL. Das Tagungsthema lautete: Fachliche Bildung und digitale Transformation - Fachdidaktische Forschung und Diskurse. Fachliche Bildung unterliegt grundlegenden Veränderungen im Zei­chen digitaler Transformation. Diese zeigen sich auf der Ebene fachli­chen Lehrens und Lernens. So wandeln sich die Rollenverteilung von Lehrenden wie Lernenden und das Bewusstsein darüber, wie Verantwortung in beiden Gruppen verteilt und genutzt werden kann. Lern­zeiten lassen sich individualisieren und Schülerinnen und Schülern er­öffnen sich neue Räume für selbstgesteuertes und partizipatives fach­liches Lernen. Zugleich sind digitale Formen der Gewinnung, Darstel­lung, Vermittlung und Aneignung fachlichen Wissens und fachbezo­gener Fähigkeiten weit mehr als neue Werkzeuge des Lehrens und Lernens im Fach. Vielmehr unterliegt jedes Fach und jede Fachdidak­tik auf je eigene Weise einem Prozess digitaler Transformation. Dieser schließt fachdidaktische Forschung und die Anforderungen an die Lehrerbildung in der ersten, zweiten und dritten Phase mit ein. Auch Fragen digitaler Ethik im Zeichen von Algorithmisierung, Big Data und KI sind berührt. Die ca. 50 Beiträge repräsentieren die fachdidaktischen Arbeiten, die in im Rahmen von Gruppenvorträgen, Einzelvorträgen, Workshops und Postern präsentiert wurden. (Herausgeber)},

Denn diese verändert sich ständig und macht neue Kompetenzen notwendig. Diesen Aspekt betont der Begriff der Eigenverantwortung, eine Schlüsselkompetenz der Zukunft und Kennzeichen einer zeitgemäßen Lernkultur. Für die Konzeption von Lernszenarien sind folglich didaktische Interventionen notwendig, um die bewusste Auseinandersetzung mit der eigenen Verantwortung im Lernen, also die eigenen Lernprozesse, das eigen handeln, die Lernleistungen und -fortschritte, zu fördern. Das Konzept des Problembasierten Lernens (PBL) kann eine solche selbständigkeitsfördernde, kognitiv aktivierende Unterrichts- oder Lernumgebungsgestaltung bieten. Die Lernenden sind, indem sie ihr Wissen selbständig anhand von praxisnahen Problemstellungen konstruieren, aktiv und eigenverantwortlich in ihren eigenen Lernprozess involviert. Der Lehrende agiert als Lernbegleiter und fördert durch aktive Betreuung des Lernprozesses das selbstständige und eigenverantwortliche Lernen. (DIPF/Orig.)},

	abstract = {Der Begriff „Digitalisierung“ ist in aller Munde und häufig werden vor allem Anforderungen formuliert, die „digitale Transformation“ in allen Bereichen der Gesellschaft mitzugestalten. In diesem Zusammenhang wird insbesondere von Hochschulen als Forschungs- und Bildungsinstitutionen erwartet, diesen Wandel aktiv mitzugestalten. Der Begriff „Digitalisierung“ erscheint einerseits als Heilsversprechen, andererseits ruft er auch Skepsis und Ängste hervor. Zugleich fällt auf, dass „Digitalisierung“ selten konkret definiert wird – vielmehr wird meist unhinterfragt vorausgesetzt, es gäbe einen Konsens, was im jeweiligen Kontext damit gemeint ist. Daher erscheint es besonders interessant, einschlägige Narrative im Zusammenhang mit dem Digitalisierungsbegriff offenzulegen und zu diskutieren sowie aus einer wissenschaftlichen und praktischen Sicht kritisch zu hinterfragen. Im Band werden deswegen die Mythen und öffentlichen Vorstellungen rund um Medien und E-Learning in den Blick genommen. Hochschule bietet dazu den wesentlichen Referenzrahmen. Darüber hinaus wird nach Realitäten und Perspektiven in diesem unbestimmten Feld gesucht. In Zusammenhang mit dem Band hat die Fachgesellschaft GMW ganz unterschiedliche Personen und Akteure direkt sowie in einem Call dazu eingeladen, sich an der Diskussion um den Status quo im Bereich der Nutzung und Bedeutung von Medien in der Wissenschaft zu beteiligen. Dieser Band bildet damit sowohl den aktuellen Stand der Diskussion alsauch ihre fachlich-inhaltlichen, methodischen und konzeptionellen Facetten ab. (DIPF/Orig.)},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: This study aimed to determine the prevalence, risk factors, symptoms, and awareness of computer vision syndrome (CVS) among medical students during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
METHODS: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted among 283 undergraduate medical students at a tertiary healthcare center. An electronic survey was conducted to collect the data. Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS version 23). The Chi-square test (Fisher's exact test when required) was used to study the significance of associations. A P value {\textless}0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: A high prevalence of CVS was observed in which 92\% reported at least one symptom while using a digital device, the most frequent being eye strain (49\%). Among extraocular complaints, joint pain in the wrist and fingers was most frequent. Significant association (P {\textless} 0.05) of CVS was found with increased duration of digital device usage, refractive error, use of glasses or contact lens, preexisting dry eye disease, and use of topical eye drops. 37\% of the participants were aware of the 20-20-20 rule, while only 11\% followed it.
CONCLUSION: CVS is a common health concern among medical students. Hence, to increase the productivity of work, significant risk factors need to be addressed and awareness must be raised.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has forced all educational institutions to adopt online learning, regardless of how ready they are for transformation. This study aims to investigate student perceptions of e-learning quality, student satisfaction, and intention to continue using online education. It is also found that students in some areas are not ready to adapt from face-to-face offline education to e-learning platforms, examining how the quality of e-learning affects student satisfaction and usage intentions will provide useful findings for policy makers and educators to improve e-learning effectiveness. Utilizing quantitative methods, this study uses an online survey questionnaire to test the suggested research hypotheses and test the proposed model. To analyze and test the data, AMOS 20.0 was used using SEM (structural equation modeling). Based on the results of testing the impact of e-learning quality on student satisfaction and sustainable use intentions among higher education students, several conclusions can be drawn. Increasing student satisfaction by improving the quality of e-learning has resulted in greater efficiency and effectiveness of student online learning performance and outcomes. There is a strong significant relationship between knowledge sharing, communication facilities, motivation and use, and acceptance of e-learning between instructors.},

	abstract = {In nursing education through team simulations, students must learn to position themselves correctly in coordination with colleagues. However, with multiple student teams in action, it is difficult for teachers to give detailed, timely feedback on these spatial behaviours to each team. Indoor-positioning technologies can now capture student spatial behaviours, but relatively little work has focused on giving meaning to student activity traces, transforming low-level x/y coordinates into language that makes sense to teachers. Even less research has investigated if teachers can make sense of that feedback. This paper therefore makes two contributions. (1) Methodologically, we document the use of Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA) as an approach to model and visualise students’ movements. To our knowledge, this is the first application of ENA to analyse human movement. (2) We evaluated teachers’ responses to ENA diagrams through qualitative analysis of video-recorded sessions. Teachers constructed consistent narratives about ENA diagrams’ meaning, and valued the new insights ENA offered. However, ENA’s abstract visualisation of spatial behaviours was not intuitive, and caused some confusions. We propose, therefore, that the power of ENA modelling can be combined with other spatial representations such as a classroom map, by overlaying annotations to create a more intuitive user experience.

This literature analysis, using directed content analysis, aims to explore the above vacuum. The research questions in this study are: (1) In what ways do the SM as e-Portfolios benefit students in HE? (2) To what extent are the benefits of SM as e-Portfolios comparable to those of conventional e-Portfolios? and (3) What are the drawbacks that practitioners and researchers need to be concerned with? Findings indicate that blogs are the most popular SM used as e-Portfolios to support learning, followed by social networking sites and collaborative projects. The study yields 13 advantages and 12 drawbacks when SM is manipulated as e-Portfolios. These findings conclude that the use of SM as e-Portfolios has a great potential in supporting students’ learning and development by providing an environment for them to learn meaningfully from their experiences and engage in critical reflections and dialogues that allow them to gain new knowledge and valuable insights and thus, improve their skills. A pedagogical framework for the planning and implementation of SM as e-Portfolios is suggested based on the findings and aims of the papers that were reviewed.},

Leading universities are developing their own Learning Management Systems (LMS) based on information and Internet technologies. However, in higher education there are certain educational tasks in the interdisciplinary ﬁeld. One of them is the task of successfully developing atomic engineering education. In this article, we present the basic design principles and architecture features of a speciﬁc LMS for the development of economic skills for education in the ﬁeld of nuclear technology.},

	abstract = {South African universities are increasing the number of students that are admitted to their degree programs. This came as a result of massiﬁcation of higher education which in turn reduces student-lecturer interaction and ability to monitor the progress of the student. Lecturers are suing technologies such as Learning Management Systems (LMS) as the solution to support these large class environments, but seldom make the effort to pedagogically integrate the technology into the teaching and learning environment. This paper investigates to what extent a LMS has been integrated into teaching and learning at a traditional university. This paper will make use of a case study to provide descriptive insight into how a LMS has been integrated into 31 large classes in the past three years dating 2015–2017 at a traditional university. The usage patterns of lecturers making use of the LMS are examined through the user statistics that were collected during this time from course request forms. The results show that the main function of the LMS during the past 3 years was course management. The LMS was used for evaluation and communication purposes, while the collaboration and teaching categories are still underdeveloped. The recommendation is then that lecturers are encouraged to properly integrate a LMS into their teaching pedagogy, and not simply use it as a management tool.},

On March 12, 2020, Universiti Brunei Darussalam (UBD) has announced that all TL will be using available online and electronic learning platforms such as CANVAS, Skype, Zoom meetings, Microsoft Team (MS Team) and Teleconferencing. This study discusses the implementation of CANVAS as one of learning management system (LMS) to teach ﬁrst year discrete mathematics to assess the students’ performance by giving them online assessments via assignments or quizzes, using built-in features on CANVAS. Based on the feedback from students, it is found that the use of CANVAS has signiﬁcantly made students’ learning more systematic and also improved the understanding of the students on the mathematics course.},

            E-Learning bietet zahlreiche Möglichkeiten, die Präsenzlehre inhaltlich und didaktisch anzureichern und damit die Studienbedingungen zu verbessern. In der Praxis fehlt den Lehrenden jedoch oftmals der zeitliche Spielraum, um entsprechende Angebote zu erstellen.

Dies bezieht sich sowohl auf die von der Bibliothek bereitgestellten Kataloge, Datenbanken und Medien, als auch die Möglichkeiten der Literatur- und Informationsverwaltung. Blickt man über die Bibliothek hinaus in andere Wirtschaftsbereiche, so stellt sich die Frage, inwieweit man von anderen Branchen lernen kann. In verschiedenen Wirtschaftsbereichen wird die Kundenbeziehung über das Kundenkonto gepflegt und intensiviert. In besonderem Maße sind die Kundenkonten von Banken und Versicherungen zu nennen. Das online-Bankkonto bietet eine Vielzahl an Funktionen, die für die Kundenbeziehung relevant sind. Diese können als Vorbild für eine Einbindung der Bibliothek in ein LMS dienen. Ebenso ist die Einbindung von Bibliothekaren zur Unterstützung der Literaturrecherche sinnvoll.},

Dieser Beitrag zeigt, wie diese Querschnittsthemen in Form von digitaler Hochschulbildung, insbesondere E-Learning, die Vermittlung und Etablierung von Bildung für nachhaltige Entwicklung (BNE) in der Bildungslandschaft fördern können. Das Ziel von BNE ist es, Lernende zu befähigen, die Auswirkungen des eigenen Handelns auf die Welt zu verstehen und verantwortungsvolle, zukunftsgerichtete Entscheidungen treffen zu können. In diesem Beitrag wird diskutiert, wie die verschiedenen Prinzipien von erfolgreichem E-Learning sowie Elementen der Gamifizierung zur Vermittlung von BNE beitragen und welche Formate zur Überprüfung des Lernerfolgs genutzt werden können.},

The web-based office simulation LUCA (funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research) addresses the domain-specific competences of students in commercial vocational education and training (VET). The office simulation provides authentic office tools such as a spreadsheet application and an ERP software to solve complex work scenarios. These scenarios are implemented via the “LUCA Editor” and can contain automated assistance based on evidence rules of certain behaviours (“scaffolding”). The real-time analysis of the resulting log files enables the analysis of individual problemsolving behaviour („Problem Solving Analytics“, PSA). Teachers and trainers can monitor their students’ problemsolving efforts in the “LUCA Dashboard”, where they can also provide individual assistance via a chat tool. In our contribution, the scientific foundations of PSA will be outlined, followed by a demonstration of the latest prototype of LUCA and visitors’ interaction with the software. LUCA’s alpha version will be released in September of this year and will be available for practitioners in vocational schools and companies.},

Das Verwertungsziel dieser Hausarbeit soll die Ableitung eines geeigneten Kollaborationstools im Kontext des Online-Lernens sein. Hierzu wird sich eine Studentin der Bildungswissenschaft an der FernUniversität Hagen im Praktikum des Modul 3 im Mai/Juni dieses Jahres der Thematik annehmen und auf Grundlage dieser Evaluation ein Moodle-Container als Projektaufgabe entwickeln. Nachhaltiges Wissensmanagement ist in der rettungsdienstlichen Ausbildung unersetzlich, um die notwendige Kompetenzstufe zu erreichen. Diese wurde in selbstorganisierten Gruppenarbeitsphasen umgesetzt. Anhand der Faktoren Zeit, Struktur und Interaktion wurde die Stärke des Einflusses in Bezug zu einer projizierten Nachhaltigkeit untersucht. Die Theorie ist durch den systemisch-konstruktivistischen Ansatz begleitet, in dem die Selbstorganisation und Autopoiesis bedeutende Rollen einnehmen. Mittels einer Online-Befragung wurde die Datenerhebung realisiert. In die Fragestellung konnte die Möglichkeit zur Nutzung von Kollaborationstools integriert werden. Die Umsetzung erfolgte durch die Korrelation und Regression der gemittelten Variablen, die Absicherung wurde anhand der Varianzanalyse vorgenommen.},

This study aimed to explore the students’ perspectives on integrating ﬂipped classrooms into LMS, which affected learning outcomes, namely productivity, time management, and critical thinking. The researchers employed a purposive sampling technique for determining the research sample in this research. Moreover, 26 college students in two classes participated in this study. The research design was mixed-method research which consists of quantitative and qualitative research. The researchers divided the semester into the conventional learning model and ﬂipped classroom. For gathering the research data, the researchers utilized a research instrument that consisted of a 22-question survey. The ﬁndings showed that collaborativedriven ﬂipped classroom in LMS was practicable and robust options for learning compared to the conventional learning pedagogy. In contrast, the researchers also found that the combination of aspects of the conventional learning model and ﬂipped classroom led this learning environment stronger than before. The instructor-led learning from the conventional classroom could be integrated with the collaboration, various activities, and in-class discussions from the ﬂipped classroom features. The integration of conventional and ﬂipped classrooms promoted the students to achieve their learning target and fostered the instructor to enable learning within collaborative activities.},

	abstract = {An adaptive learning system aims to provide learning that is adapted to a learner’s current status, different from the traditional classroom experience. A key element of an adaptive learning system is the recommendation system, which provides the most suitable resources based on learner proﬁles. Recommending the most appropriate learning resources to learners has always been a challenge in the ﬁeld of e-learning. Thus, learners may have difﬁculties in choosing the appropriate material when faced with a large volume of recommended material during their learning process. This challenge led us to implement a chatbot to help learners improve their learning experience and knowledge. New solutions use artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) techniques such as machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP). The use of our chatbot integrated in Moodle, named LearningPartnerBot, provides learners a personalized recommendation of learning objects according to two strategies, one based on their knowledge level (KL) and the other based on their learning style (LS). The objective of this article is to compare the learning outcomes obtained after the realization of the two experiments based on these two approaches centered mainly on the use of the LearningPartnerBot. Consequently, the approach of recommending learning objects based on the knowledge level gave promising results by guaranteeing a more adapted learning to the learners.},

Contrary to traditional teaching (classroom), distance learning is characterized by the lack of physical contact between instructors and students and also between students within a classroom. Unfortunately, some learners may fail or even stop learning online quite quickly. In addition, learners ﬁnd it more difﬁcult to learn, not because there is not enough content, but because there is too much and they cannot ﬁnd what is useful and up-to-date. This study aims to prove the importance of using social and adaptive learning to overcome the problems that learners face in online learning platforms, we propose a model to determine the effects of using the two types of platforms in online learning, namely Learning Management System (LMS) and Learning Experience Platform (LXP) for two groups of learners in Moroccan higher education applying social learning analysis (SLA). Speciﬁcally, in this proposal we attempt to analyze data from the LMS and LXP platforms to build knowledge models about students and determine their learning styles based on their interactions on these platforms, improve their learning experience and predict the conditions that favor their progress and success in order to recreate the conditions for quality social learning and help learners ﬁnd possible paths to success in the online learning platforms in Morocco.},

	abstract = {In professional fields of work like aviation, chemical industry and nuclear energy as well as in emergency and acute medicine the staff is frequently confronted with time-critical, dynamic and complex situations characterised by uncertainty. Errors in human behaviour (human factors) lead decisively to an increase in the risk potential for those involved, up to and including a failure to cope with the situation. In order to avoid treatment errors and to increase patient safety in emergency and acute medicine, cognitive aids are increasingly being developed, e.g. in the form of checklists, which are intended to contribute as mobile learning applications to the confident management of critical situations. This paper focusses on the linguistic formulation of cognitive aids in Germanspeaking countries in order to simplify the development process and to improve the usability of these tools for staff and managers. In order to achieve this, this study examines whether and which of 3 different linguistically designed prototypical checklists provided are rated by paramedics as particularly suitable for use in regular operation. For this purpose, one checklist each with imperative, infinitive and mixed action instructions is used in the study. The data come from 4 further education course surveys with German-speaking paramedics (n=62) from the year 2021. The results show a higher usability for one of the prototypical checklists examined in the dimensions of effectiveness and efficiency.},

Ambient Intelligence is an optional tool for this purpose. Because Ambient intelligence-based systems allow personal access for the end-user; it is, therefore, an option for Learning Management Systems use. A Learning Management System provides students with information content and educational resources based on the web but in the same format for all users. Ambient Intelligence in fact makes it possible to give a speciﬁc answer to each student according to his character and personal characteristics and thus maximize his use of these systems for more efﬁcient use. An advanced and innovative learning system will integrate all the learning processes relevant to the particular learner according to his abilities - his weaknesses and strengths. In this paper, we offer a structure for the use of Ambient Intelligence for academic Learning Management System. On the one hand - by deﬁning the habits and needs of the student and on the other hand by mapping the skill that the systems need for relevant processing. This will create a customized interface to the speciﬁc needs of the student.},

	abstract = {With an increasing interest in personalized learning, active research is being conducted on knowledge tracing to predict the learner’s knowledge state. Recently, studies have attempted to improve the performance of the knowledge tracing model by incorporating various types of side information. We propose a knowledge tracing method that utilizes the learner’s language proﬁciency as side information. Language proﬁciency is a key component of comprehending a question’s text and is known to be closely related to students’ academic performance. In this study, language proﬁciency was deﬁned with Elo rating score and time window features, and was used in the knowledge tracing task. The dataset used in this study contains 54,470 students and 7,619,040 interactions, which were collected from a real-world online-learning platform. We conducted a correlation analysis to determine whether the language proﬁciency information of students was related to their ability to solve math word problems. In addition, we examined the effect of incorporating the language proﬁciency information on the knowledge tracing models using various baseline models. The analysis revealed a high correlation between the length of word problems and students’ language proﬁciency. Furthermore, in experiments with various baseline models, utilizing the language proﬁciency information improved the knowledge tracing model’s performance. Finally, when language proﬁciency information was incorporated, the cold start problem of the knowledge tracing model was mitigated. The ﬁndings of this study can be used as a supplement for educational instruction.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has led to dramatic changes in education triggering a sharp increase in the adoption of e-learning, whereby teaching is carried out remotely via digital platforms. Computer-based learning systems offer beneﬁts by increased ﬂexibility about place, time and learning pace. In addition, these platforms tend to be far more interactive with respect to language instruction compared to traditional learning settings. Still, there is an evident lack of empirical research on the various challenges and learning metrics e-learning methodologies exposes. While approaches exist to measure the learning progress of students in e-learning environments, practical comparisons and analysis of different learning scenarios and its obstacles are still rare. This paper explicitly addresses this gap by surveying the practices and challenges involved in using selected synchronous online tools and discussing the feedback of students and teaching staff during the prolonged periods of online-teaching. The results presented here, albeit limited, strongly suggest that language students tend to regard online-teaching very positively. While the possibility of staying at home and the increased schedule ﬂexibility were clearly seen by a majority of our participants as an advantage, the lack of in-person contacts and recurring technical problems, were often cited drawbacks. Instructors, on the other hand, consistently mentioned the lack of student discipline and insufﬁcient IT knowledge as their major challenges in using synchronous online-teaching. While, we do not claim that the results are applicable to other learning ﬁelds, we point out which factors inﬂuenced the learning experience most and suggest possible ways for successful e-learning.},

The third part demonstrates the advantages and prospects of the computer models and simulators implementation.

	abstract = {Lebenslanges und Selbstgesteuertes Lernen wird heutzutage von nahezu allen Arbeitnehmern gefordert. Das Fachwissen muss erweitert und aktualisiert werden. Weiterbildungsmaánahmen in Pr„senzform allein k”nnen diese Forderung nicht erf llen. Eine Kombination von Pr„senz- und E-Learning Phasen hat sich f r Lernende als sehr wirkungsvoll erwiesen. Dieses Buch beschreibt nach Vorstellung allgemeiner Kriterien ber das E- Learning die Erstellung einer medialen Lernumgebung f r einen Weiterbildungskurs f r den Operationsdienst. Zuerst wird in Kapitel 2 die Forderung der heutigen Zeit nach Lebenslangem Lernen vorgestellt. Die Ausl”ser f r dieses Konzept und Begriffe, die mit diesem in Verbindung gebracht werden, wie zum Beispiel Kompetenzentwicklung und selbstgesteuertes Lernen, werden etwas n„her erl„utert, da diese Forderung auch als Grobziel der Weiterbildung f r den Operationsdienst formuliert ist. Nach der deduktiven Methode werden in Kapitel 3 zun„chst die allgemeinen Aspekte von E- Learning betrachtet. Die Vielfalt des elektronisch unterst tzten Lernens wird vorgestellt, indem zuerst die Definitionen erkl„rt und die verschiedenen Formen dieses Lernens, sowie die beeinflussenden Lerntheoretischen Ans„tze vorgestellt werden. Danach wird kurz auf die sich ver„nderte Rolle des Lehrenden eingegangen. Auáerdem werden die beim E-Learning m”glichen Kommunikations- und Kooperationsformen beschrieben. Hiernach werden motivationsf”rdernde Interaktionen erl„utert, die beim E-Learning eine sehr wichtige Rolle einnehmen, um Lernfrust zu vermeiden und eine kontinuierliche Teilnahme der Lernenden am medialen Lernangebot zu gew„hrleisten. Als letzter Unterpunkt des dritten Kapitels erfolgt eine zusammenfassende Darstellung der Potentiale, des Mehrwerts und der Grenzen von E-Learning. Kapitel 4 f hrt dann in die Gestaltungstheoretische Mediendidaktik nach Kerres ein, auf der die Konzeption der Lernumgebung f r den Weiterbildungskurs aufgebaut ist. Nach dieser kurzen allgemeing ltigen Vorstellung wird nun in Kapitel 5 die Gestaltungsorientierte Mediendidaktik Schritt f r Schritt auf das Fallbeispiel umgesetzt. Es erfolgt die Definition des Projektziels. Die Zielgruppe wird genau analysiert und die Lehrziele und Inhalte bestimmt. Hiernach erfolgt die didaktische Transformation der festgelegten Inhalte zu den Lernangeboten. Die didaktische Aufbereitung der medialen Lernumgebung mit den verschiedenen Lernaufgaben wird detailliert erl„utert. Aspekte der Lernorganisation und die verwendeten Medien und Hilfsmittel werden vorgestellt. Da eine Qualit„tssicherung bei Bildungsmaánahmen unumg„nglich ist, werden eine durchgef hrte formative Evaluation und deren Auswertung beschrieben. Zum Schluss dieses Kapitels erfolgt eine abschlieáende Betrachtung in Bezug auf die in der Einleitung formulierten Fragestellungen. Der Abschluss besteht aus einer Zusammenfassung mit einem Ausblick.},

            Die systematische Untersuchung der Gebrauchstauglichkeit (Usability) von Online-Lernplattformen stellt eine wichtige Voraussetzung dar, um die Erfahrungen, Probleme und Wünsche der Nutzerinnen und Nutzer angemessen einschätzen sowie bei der Gestaltung oder Weiterentwicklung des E-Learning-Angebots einbeziehen zu können. Dieses Kapitel zeigt am Beispiel der Online-Lernplattform ViviAn, wie das Vorhaben einer Usability-Evaluation gelingen kann. Das Nutzungsverhalten bei der Bearbeitung von Lerneinheiten wurde über einen mehrwöchigen Erhebungszeitraum mittels Matomo Analytics für 168 Studierende erfasst und quantifiziert. Ergänzend füllten die Teilnehmenden einen Fragebogen aus, in dem Einschätzungen zu verschiedenen Aspekten der Lernplattform erhoben wurden. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die Lernplattform überdurchschnittlich gut bewertet wird. Die Auswertung zeigt darüber hinaus, dass die Mehrheit der Nutzerinnen und Nutzer mit einer geeigneten Bildschirmauflösung gearbeitet und die neu hinzugefügten Funktionalitäten (z. B. Skalierbarkeit und Verschiebbarkeit von Fenstern und Menüs) auch genutzt haben. Im Zuge der Auswertung der Freitextantworten konnten weitere Usability-Probleme und Wünsche identifiziert werden, die im Rahmen der Weiterentwicklung von ViviAn berücksichtigt werden, um einen – gemäß der Usability-Definition – noch effektiveren, effizienteren und zufriedenstellenderen Gebrauch der Plattform zu ermöglich.},

	abstract = {With distance learning, the issue of organizing and conducting laboratory work in physics becomes relevant. It is clear that it is impossible to completely translate experimental science into a remote format, but thanks to modern video cameras, this is partially possible. Our goal: to develop a method for analyzing video ﬁles for remote laboratory work in physics without using programming skills. As an example, laboratory work from the section “Mechanics” and “Thermal radiation” are given. An algorithm for obtaining experimental data, an algorithm for spatial calibration in the ImageJ program is described. The results of the correlation analysis of student feedback on the proposed methodology are presented. It is shown that 25\% of students are ready to overcome difﬁculties arising in the process of mastering the methodology in order to obtain additional competencies (p = 0.66). The majority of students (75\%) consider tasks to be extremely difﬁcult and they cannot get the desired skills and abilities. The above facts indicate that the proposed methodology is intended for students with high motivation to learn. They also testify in favor of students’ independent choice of methods, techniques and tools used in experiments.},

In open distance e-learning, computer-supported learning is instrumental in providing a platform for graduate students to develop their argumentation skills. However, there is little guidance on the elements required in using computer supportive collaborative learning (CSCL) to augment argumentation skills development (ASD). This paper reports on elements identiﬁed in literature that should be present in a framework using CSCL to augment ASD. The thematically analysed data gathered during the focus group sessions were used to conﬁrm the structure of the argumentation skills development framework (ASDF), and conﬁrmed that there is a need for a framework to provide guidance in using CSCL to augment ASD. The contribution includes the conceptual ASDF using CSCL, comprising seven elements, that provides a strategy of scaﬀolded learning for implementation in a graduate course to augment ASD.},

Speciﬁcally, one of its applications is a computerized assessment quiz for detecting developmental disabilities in infants online at the earliest stage. Notably, this smartphone app can detect a developmental delay at such an age when only proven behavioral markers are challenging since behavioral markers are based to a large extent on verbal communication. The theoretical approach to the problem discusses interaction modality at the onset of cognition from perspectives of communication theory, embodied dynamicism, and genetics. Newborns and even already fetuses demonstrate different social achievements, respectively–early imitation, other-race effect, facial attractiveness, distinguishing mother and stranger, other-species effect, preference of faces, recognition of other newborns crying, as well as twin fetuses comovements, recognition of voices, emotion expression–which are not consistent with their cognitive and communicative abilities. The article discusses the Primary Data Entry (PDE) problem: what interaction modality provides acquiring initial social data at the beginning of life. How does shared intentionality emerge in organisms? This question can guide understanding interaction modality at the onset of cognition that is critical for many rapidly evolving knowledge domains, such as assessment tool of a developmental delay and advanced e-learning. This article is one of the ﬁrst attempts to build a framework for a theoretical model of shared intentionality by discussing theoretical approaches and empirical data of intelligence and cognitive processes in interpersonal interaction.},

              Ausgehend vom Bedarf, Lehrpersonen zu befähigen, eigene digitale Lernangebote zu konzipieren, lerntheoretisch fundiert zu gestalten und zielgruppenorientiert einzusetzen, entwickelte die Fachdidaktik Geographie der TU Kaiserslautern (TUK) in Kooperation mit dem eTeaching Service Center (eTSC) des Distance and Independent Studies Center (DISC) den von Tutorinnen sowie Fachexperten und -expertinnen moderierten Online-Kurs „Digitale Lernangebote selbst gestalten“. Er adressierte in zwei Durchläufen bislang mehr als 600 Personen in Ausbildung und Beruf im Lehr-Lern-Kontext Schule sowie Erwachsenenbildung. Die Kommunikation in moderierten Foren ermöglichte es den Teilnehmenden und Lehrenden, unter- und miteinander in einen konstruktiven Diskurs zu treten. Was entstand, war eine komplexe Lerngelegenheit für alle Beteiligten, um digitale Lernangebote zur Gestaltung digitaler Lernumgebungen intensiver einsetzen zu können. Durch
              Peer
              -Lernen konnten die Teilnehmenden die eigenen fachlichen Inhalte und Vermittlungsmethoden durch das Feedback von Fachfremden reflektieren sowie Bestärkung in neuen kreativen Umsetzungsideen mit der im Kurs verwendeten Applikation erhalten. Der Beitrag skizziert konzeptionelle Überlegungen und den Aufbau des achtwöchigen Kurses sowie die Erfahrung mit dieser Öffnung der Hochschullehre für eine heterogene Teilnehmerschaft. Einige Kursinhalte wurden parallel zum Online-Kurs auch im Sinne des
              Blended Learning
              in fachdidaktischen Lehrveranstaltungen der Biologie und Geographie eingesetzt. Einzelne ausgewählte Lernangebote, die Studierende erstellt haben, werden ergänzend vorgestellt.},

Häufig bleibt dabei jedoch unklar, was genau unter der «neuen Lernkultur» zu verstehen ist, und auch die empirische Evidenz steht bezüglich vieler Aspekte noch aus. In diesem Beitrag wird ein Modell der ‹neuen Lernkultur› vorgestellt. Anhand der Teilaspekte ‹Partizipation› und ‹Kooperation› wird anschliessend die theoretische Diskussion über das Potenzial von E-Portfolios als Schulentwicklungsinstrument exemplarisch skizziert. Zur Überprüfung der theoretischen Annahmen wurde im Jahr 2016 eine systematische qualitative Fallstudie mit sechs Lehrpersonen durchgeführt, die E-Portfolios im Unterricht der Sekundarstufe I/II einsetzen. Die Ergebnisse verdeutlichen eine grosse Diskrepanz zwischen theoretischem Anspruch und beobachteter Praxis. Basierend auf den Studienerkenntnissen gilt es die Chancen und Grenzen von E-Portfolios als Entwicklungsinstrument einer neuen Lernkultur zu diskutieren.},

	abstract = {Background: The evidence for the positive impact of an electronic Portfolio (ePortfolio) on feedback in medicine is mixed. An ePortfolio for medical long cases in a Graduate Medical Program was developed. The purpose of this study was to explore the perceptions of medical students and faculty of the impact of the ePortfolio on the feedback process.
Methods: In total, 130 Year 3 medical students, and six faculty participated in the study. This is a mixed methods study, using a combination of both quantitative and qualitative approaches. Quantitative methods were used to quantify the number of long cases performed. Qualitative methods were used to explore the relationship between quantity and quality of feedback, and provide a rich understanding of both students’ and faculty’s experience and perceptions of the ePortfolio.
Results: Students received a variable quantity of feedback at each of the three studied clinical schools, with an average of between 4 – 5.4 feedback episodes per student. Feedback that was constructive, specific and timely and delivered by a senior academic was important. Quantity was not an essential factor, with two episodes of detailed feedback reported to be adequate. The barriers to the use of the ePortfolio were technical aspects of the platform that interfered with student engagement.
Conclusions: Feedback using the ePortfolio for medical long cases is a valuable tool providing a senior clinician delivers detailed, constructive and personalized feedback in a timely fashion. The ePortfolio system needs to be user-friendly to engage students.},

	abstract = {Christian Fischer und Johanna Grad diskutieren in ihrem Beitrag "Wege zu neuen Bewertungssystemen in der Hochschullehre: Gameful Learning und Pädagogische Psychologie" die Einführung innovativer Lehr- und Bewertungsmethoden an Hochschulen.

Gameful Learning als innovativer Ansatz: Gameful Learning kombiniert Prinzipien des Game-Designs mit pädagogischer Psychologie und ist in Selbstbestimmungstheorie und Konstruktivismus verankert. Es zielt darauf ab, das Engagement, die intrinsische Motivation und die Lernerfolge der Studierenden zu verbessern, indem vielseitige Lernumgebungen geschaffen werden, die Autonomie, soziales Zugehörigkeitsgefühl und Kompetenz der Lernenden fördern.
Traditionelle Bewertungssysteme vs. Gameful Learning: Im Gegensatz zu traditionellen Bewertungssystemen, die sich auf normierte Kriterien und summative Evaluationen wie Klausuren und Tests stützen, erlaubt Gameful Learning den Studierenden, ihren Lernerfolg durch eine Vielzahl von Aktivitäten zu gestalten und zu beeinflussen. Beispielsweise können sie Punkte durch verschiedene Aktivitäten sammeln, um eine bestimmte Note zu erreichen.
Elemente des Gameful Learnings:
Autonomie: Studierende können aus verschiedenen Aufgaben wählen, um Punkte zu sammeln.
Soziale Zugehörigkeit: Gameful Learning fördert Gruppenarbeit und Kollaboration und betont aktives Lernen.
Kompetenz: Aufgaben bieten unterschiedliche Schwierigkeitsgrade und Herausforderungen und ermöglichen individuelle Lernerfahrungen.
Beispiel für Gameful Learning: Das Lernmanagement-System GradeCraft unterstützt diese Methode und bietet Funktionen wie einen Grade Predictor, der Studierenden hilft, ihren Lernweg zu planen und zu überwachen.
Positive Effekte von Gameful Learning: Studien zeigen, dass Studierende in Gameful Learning-Kursen bessere Noten erzielen, aktiver sind und ein stärkeres Gefühl der Kontrolle über ihre Bewertung haben. Diese Methode wird als fairer und effektiver im Vergleich zu herkömmlichen Notensystemen wahrgenommen.
Insgesamt argumentieren Fischer und Grad, dass Gameful Learning das Potenzial hat, die Lehr- und Lernprozesse im Hochschulbereich zu verbessern und zu unterstützen.},

The development and usage of virtual learning environments offers the chance to deepen the theoretical prior knowledge through interactive learning possibilities. In this way, existing learning concepts are supplemented with virtual teaching content. Complex or difficult to present learning settings can be mapped virtually without high material consumption or costs. This paper presents the state of the art with respect to teaching quality methods with VR. An integration in the Assisted Reality Implementation Model is made. Subsequently, the requirements for a virtual learning environment based on a real business game are determined. The approach and implementation are explained using the example of the PDCA quality method. PDCA is an iterative design and management method used in business for the control and continual improvement of processes and products. First results of the exploration tests from the questionnaires are presented. Based on this, improvements are derived, and next steps are defined.},

This chapter explores the prevalence, contributing factors, prevention strategies, and management approaches related to burnout in this speciﬁc student population. In developing countries, students face unique challenges such as resource constraints, limited access to modern educational facilities, socioeconomic pressures, and cultural expectations. These factors intensify the risk of burnout, making it imperative to adopt tailored strategies for prevention and management. Recommendations include resource allocation, ﬁnancial support, curriculum adaptation, mental health services, early identiﬁcation, faculty and peer support, ﬂexibility in learning, and community engagement. Furthermore, fostering a culture of empathy, resilience, and self-care within healthcare education is essential. By implementing these recommendations, stakeholders can protect student wellbeing and contribute to the development of a resilient, compassionate, and highly skilled healthcare workforce. This, in turn, can enhance the quality of healthcare services and patient outcomes while addressing the unique challenges faced in developing countries.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has presented unique challenges for developing countries, necessitating innovative and adaptive strategies for effective management. This chapter delves into the multifaceted aspects of COVID-19 management in these regions. Developing countries, often characterized by limited healthcare resources and socio-economic vulnerabilities, have faced an uphill battle in the ﬁght against COVID-19. However, amidst these challenges lie opportunities for creative and impactful solutions. This chapter provides a condensed overview of the key recommendations to enhance COVID-19 management in developing countries. A critical element is the imperative to strengthen healthcare infrastructure. Increasing hospital capacity, healthcare workforce training, and the supply of medical essentials like ventilators and personal protective equipment are essential steps. Additionally, harnessing telemedicine and telehealth services can alleviate the burden on healthcare facilities, ensuring that patients continue to receive quality care while minimizing the risk of viral transmission. Expanding testing and vaccination efforts is another pivotal strategy. Accessibility to testing, contact tracing, and the equitable distribution of vaccines are vital components of this approach. Community engagement and public health campaigns play a fundamental role in dispelling vaccine hesitancy and misinformation. To ensure long-term resilience, a holistic approach is necessary. This includes addressing mental health support, economic vulnerabilities, and education continuity. The pandemic’s toll on mental health requires teletherapy services and community support groups. Economic safety nets, food security measures, and targeted ﬁnancial assistance are essential to alleviate the economic burden on vulnerable populations. For education, a blend of e-learning platforms, local partnerships, and innovative ﬁnancing mechanisms can help ensure that students’ educational needs are met. International collaboration is critical in the global ﬁght against COVID-19. Developing countries should leverage partnerships with international organizations, neighboring countries, and private sector entities to secure resources, expertise, and vaccines. Collaboration with local leaders, inﬂuencers, and healthcare workers enhances the effectiveness of public health campaigns. Lastly, continuous monitoring and adaptability are essential components of effective COVID-19 management. Regular assessment, data-driven decisionmaking, and a focus on research and local solutions contribute to a dynamic response that can evolve with the pandemic. In conclusion, managing COVID-19 in developing countries requires a comprehensive, adaptable, and collaborative approach that addresses healthcare, economic, and socio-cultural factors. By implementing these recommendations tailored to local contexts, developing countries can strengthen their resilience in the face of the ongoing pandemic and future health crises.},

	abstract = {Data analytics provide an important contribution to improving educational processes, as well as managerial and organisational processes in higher education. They are also significant in transforming behavioural, performance, and interaction data on digital learning platforms into pivotal information about the learning process. This chapter presents analysis results from instructional and behavioural formative assessment data for an online common course stored on a Turkish state university’s learning management system using cluster analysis. This chapter focuses on evaluating activity and assessment data to discover student groups as an important input of assessment analytics. Developing supervised models require a priori labels, such as individual student success or fail scores, and a multidimensional dataset identifying relevant performance information gathered during the learning process. In a more realistic setting, the labels are not fully known until the semester end and supervised learning models may then create learning bias when trained only using assessment data. Therefore, cluster analysis presents a promising approach through observing performance similarities between students not yet evaluated for a course or subjected to end-of-term assessment. Although feedback mechanisms were not studied in this chapter, this approach can further help achieve necessary steps to increase student success before a course ends. This study grouped students based on learning performance data using cluster analysis, with models developed and evaluated according to various performance indicators.},

Among the program’s aims is to determine the ablest interns and connect them with top employers in a merit-based system. Hence, all applying interns are put through an assessment procedure that determines their level of competence and capability. To be able to develop such a system, the program is designed in three meso-cycles following educational design research, and the assessment procedure of the program is based on assessment analytics. By studying the development cycles of the program, this study aims to achieve three goals: (1) how can assessment analytics be effectively utilized for the purpose of summative assessment, (2) how can assessment analytics be applied within a nationwide scale, and (3) how assessment analytics can be applied in experiential learning contexts. For these aims, the study focuses on the practices for the management of the talent pool of NIP to investigate how data-driven decision-making was supported and competence-based application evaluation was assured. These practices and the program overall were evaluated using satisfaction surveys filled by both students and employers that participated in NIP, and the findings indicated great satisfaction from both parties towards the measurement method, the reliability of the measurement, and the usability of the system.},

The results identify dashboards supporting collaborative tools, both synchronous and asynchronous, along categories such as learning management systems, communication tools, social media, computer programming code management platforms, project management platforms, and collaborative writing tools. Dashboard support was also found for collaborative activities, grouped under four categories of forum discussion activities, three categories of communication activities and four categories of collaborative editing/sharing activities, though most of the analysed dashboards only provide support for no more than two or three collaborative tools. This represents a need for further research on how to develop dashboards that combine data from a more diverse set of collaborative activities and tools.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: As healthcare continues to expand online and digital care offerings multiply, the importance of digital inclusion and equity is now better recognized. Yet despite impressive regional grassroots efforts, today there remain few readily deployable programs designed to support patient digital literacy.
METHODS: Digital Outreach for Obtaining Resources and Skills (DOORs) is one such digital literacy program that has evolved over the last 5 years to meet the rising demand. Through community partnerships, the DOORs curriculum and delivery has been updated to make the program more accessible and applicable as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) changes healthcare. Participants' experience in the most updated iteration of DOORS was assessed through surveys and semi-structured interviews.
RESULTS: Improvements to DOORs include an updated DOORs curriculum, updated facilitator manual, an online platform with a learning management system, standardized training, patient-facing educational handouts, consolidation of all DOORs materials into a single package that is ready to be shared with other groups, implementation of a single-session intervention model, and Spanish translation. Participants reported improved confidence on 72\% of the digital skills assessed. Thematic analysis resulted in three themes: awareness of divide, patient-centered design, and expanded skills and confidence.
CONCLUSIONS: Combined, these changes and participant outcomes better position DOORS to meet the rising need for digital literacy and offers a scalable model for teams across the world.},

	abstract = {Background: Self-regulation of learning is considered one of the key capabilities deemed essential for the healthcare system and its workers to cope successfully with the current challenges they are facing. Therefore, healthcare curricula are increasingly called upon to support self-regulation as a central learning outcome. With scant relevant publications describing how students of medicine and other healthcare professions regulate their learning, this study set out to design and assess a problem-based learning using digital concept mapping in an online course and to evaluate the set of connections between this intervention and Health Management students’ self-regulation of learning.
Method: Students of a Management of Health Service Organizations program (100) were presented with an illstructured problem, relevant to their course content (accreditation process within hospitals) and were asked to argue for or against the implementation of the accreditation process. The participants were asked to detail five arguments to establish their decision by using Mindomo, a popular digital platform for designing concept maps. The students were given predefined criteria that allowed them to self-assess their maps. Data for the analysis were gathered by two measurements: Concept mapping for problem-based learning scale and the Online self-regulated learning scale and were analyzed by using Partial Least Squares - Structural Equation Modeling.
Results: The analyses showed that at the beginning of the process, students’ online self-regulation was found lower than at the end of the intervention, and only two self-regulation sub-factors: Goal setting and Task strategies, were positively linked to students’ perceptions of the intervention. After the intervention, the analyses showed that it increased the levels of four Online self-regulation sub-factors: Goal setting, Task strategies, Environment structuring, and Time management.
Conclusions: Teachers need to recognize and account for different types of learners and encourage and scaffold students’ effective use of self-regulation strategies. Low self-regulated learners might fail to see the advantages of concept mapping in problem-solving activities. Combining these teaching and learning tools together with the use of advanced technology in an online course that encourages active learning enables the development and acquisition of abilities of self-directed learning among students in the medical and health management professions.},

	abstract = {Background: Scaling up improved management of severe acute malnutrition has been identified as the nutrition intervention with the largest potential to reduce child mortality, but lack of operational capacity at all levels of the health system constrains scale-up. We therefore developed an interactive malnutrition eLearning course that is accessible at scale to build capacity of the health sector workforce to manage severely malnourished children according to the guidelines of the World Health Organization. Objective: The aim of this study was to test whether the malnutrition eLearning course improves knowledge and skills of in-service and preservice health professionals in managing children with severe acute malnutrition and enables them to apply the gained knowledge and skills in patient care. Methods: This 2-year prospective, longitudinal, cross-country, interrupted time-series study took place in Ghana, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Colombia between January 2015 and February 2017. A subset of 354 in-service health personnel from 12 hospitals and 2 Ministries of Health, 703 preservice trainees from 9 academic institutions, and 204 online users participated. Knowledge gained after training and retention over time was measured through pre- and postassessments comprising questions pertaining to screening, diagnosis, pathophysiology and treatment, and prevention of malnutrition. Comprehension, application, and integration of knowledge were tested. Changes in perception, confidence, and clinical practice were assessed through questionnaires and interviews. Results: Before the course, awareness of the World Health Organization guidelines was 36.73\% (389/1059) overall, and 26.3\% (94/358) among in-service professionals. The mean score gain in knowledge after access to the course in 606 participants who had pre- and postassessment data was 11.8 (95\% CI 10.8-12.9; P{\textless}.001)?a relative increase of 41.5\%. The proportion of participants who achieved a score above the pass mark posttraining was 58.7\% (356/606), compared with 18.2\% (110/606) in pretraining. Of the in-service professionals, 85.9\% (128/149) reported applying their knowledge by changing their clinical practice in screening, assessment, diagnosis, and management. This group demonstrated significantly increased retained knowledge 6 months after training (mean difference [SD] from preassessment of 12.1 [11.8]), retaining 65.8\% (12.1/18.4) of gained knowledge from the training. Changes in the management of malnutrition were reported by trained participants, and institutional, operational, and policy changes were also found. Conclusions: The malnutrition eLearning course improved knowledge, understanding, and skills of health professionals in the diagnosis and management of children with severe acute malnutrition, and changes in clinical practice and confidence were reported following the completion of the course.},

	abstract = {Background: Massive open online courses (MOOCs) have become commonplace in the e-learning landscape. Thousands of elderly learners are participating in courses offered by various institutions on a multitude of platforms in many different languages. However, there is very little research into understanding elderly learners in MOOCs. Objective: We aim to show that a considerable proportion of elderly learners are participating in MOOCs and that there is a lack of research in this area. We hope this assertion of the wide gap in research on elderly learners in MOOCs will pave the way for more research in this area. Methods: Pre-course survey data for 10 University of Reading courses on the FutureLearn platform were analyzed to show the level of participation of elderly learners in MOOCs. Two MOOC aggregator sites (Class Central and MOOC List) were consulted to gather data on MOOC offerings that include topics relating to aging. In parallel, a selected set of MOOC platform catalogues, along with a recently published review on health and medicine-related MOOCs, were searched to find courses relating to aging. A systematic literature search was then employed to identify research articles on elderly learners in MOOCs. Results: The 10 courses reviewed had a considerable proportion of elderly learners participating in them. For the over-66 age group, this varied from 0.5\% (on the course ?Managing people?) to 16.3\% (on the course ?Our changing climate?), while for the over-56 age group it ranged from 3.0\% (on ?A beginners guide to writing in English?) to 39.5\% (on ?Heart health?). Only six MOOCs were found to include topics related to aging: three were on the Coursera platform, two on the FutureLearn platform, and one on the Open2Study platform. Just three scholarly articles relating to MOOCs and elderly learners were retrieved from the literature search. Conclusions: This review presents evidence to suggest that elderly learners are already participating in MOOCs. Despite this, there has been very little research into their engagement with MOOCs. Similarly, there has been little research into exploiting the scope of MOOCs for delivering topics that would be of interest to elderly learners. We believe there is potential to use MOOCs as a way of tackling the issue of loneliness among older adults by engaging them as either resource personnel or learners.},

The Young Innovative Leadership Program (YILP) designed for undergraduate and postgraduate medical sciences students, implemented at the Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, aimed to cultivate leadership capacities through a 16-week training program. This program comprises ten modules covering innovation, change leadership, and management skills, with mentor-facilitated group discussions. This study aimed to provide a qualitative report of the experiences of participants in the YILP.
Methods  A qualitative study was conducted in 2022, three months after the end of the training program, to investigate the participants’ perspectives. Data was extracted through in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 14 participants.
Results  In this study 14 undergraduate and postgraduate medical sciences students who had participated in the YILP the previous year were included. Four main categories emerged from the interviews: “emergence of new horizons”, “values as beacon”, “an expanded toolbox”, and “program’s structure: a learning atmosphere”.
Conclusions  The results of our study indicated that medical science students would benefit from leadership development programs. In this regard, the framework utilized to implement YILP could serve as a role model.},

Learning Analytics has long been criticised for focusing too much on the analytics, and not enough on the learning. The review is then guided by an interest in whether these dashboards are still primarily analytics-driven or if they have become pedagogically informed over time. By mapping the identified themes of technological maturity, informing frameworks, affordances, data sources, and analytical levels over publications per year, the review identifies an emerging trajectory towards studentfocused dashboards. These dashboards are informed by theory-oriented frameworks, designed to incorporate affordances that supporting student learning, and realised through integration of more than just activity data from learning management systems – allowing the dashboards to better support students’ learnings processes. Based on this emerging trajectory, the review provides a series of design recommendations for student-focused dashboards that are connected to learning sciences as well as analytics.},

	abstract = {Given the focus on boosting retention rates and the potential benefits of proactive and early identification of students who may require support, higher education institutions are looking at the data already captured in university systems. Student early alert systems are part of formal, proactive, early intervention communication initiatives that institutions have put into place to help with the timely identification and intervention (alert) of at-risk students. The significance of student early alert systems is that support could be offered to high-risk students while they are still enrolled in the unit and able to influence their success/failure before the unit completes. Delivering timely interventions to students via a student early alert system typically requires teaching staff to identify at-risk students, and act upon that information in a way that would encourage students to change their behaviours. However, little is understood regarding teachers’ needs and attitudes towards the use of such a system. In the context of a prototype early alert system, this article reports the practices and opinions of a range of teaching staff across all fac­ ulties within an institution. The article sheds light on how teachers measure student performance and engagement in their units, and the perceived benefits and barriers of using the early alert system to identify and manage at-risk students.},

	abstract = {Background: Computer-based teaching (CBT) is a well-known educational device, but it has never been applied systematically to the teaching of a complex, rare, genetic disease, such as Hunter disease (MPS II). Aim: To develop interactive teaching software functioning as a virtual clinic for the management of MPS II. Implementation and Results: The Hunter disease eClinic, a self-training, user-friendly educational software program, available at the Lysosomal Storage Research Group (http://www.lysosomalstorageresearch.ca), was developed using the Adobe Flash multimedia platform. It was designed to function both to provide a realistic, interactive virtual clinic and instantaneous access to supporting literature on Hunter disease. The Hunter disease eClinic consists of an eBook and an eClinic. The eClinic is the interactive virtual clinic component of the software. Within an environment resembling a real clinic, the trainee is instructed to perform a medical history, to examine the patient, and to order appropriate investigation. The program provides clinical data derived from the management of actual patients with Hunter disease. The eBook provides instantaneous, electronic access to a vast collection of reference information to provide detailed background clinical and basic science, including relevant biochemistry, physiology, and genetics. In the eClinic, the trainee is presented with quizzes designed to provide immediate feedback on both trainee effectiveness and efficiency. User feedback on the merits of the program was collected at several seminars and formal clinical rounds at several medical centres, primarily in Canada. In addition, online usage statistics were documented for a 2-year period. Feedback was consistently positive and confirmed the practical benefit of the program. The online English-language version is accessed daily by users from all over the world; a Japanese translation of the program is also available. Conclusions: The Hunter disease eClinic employs a CBT model providing the trainee with realistic clinical problems, coupled with comprehensive basic and clinical reference information by instantaneous access to an electronic textbook, the eBook. The program was rated highly by attendees at national and international presentations. It provides a potential model for use as an educational approach to other rare genetic diseases.},

	abstract = {Collaboration is argued to be an important skill, not only in schools and higher education contexts but also in the workspace and other aspects of life. However, simply asking students to work together as a group on a task does not guarantee success in collaboration. Effective collaborative learning requires meaningful interactions among individuals in a group. Recent advances in multimodal data collection tools and AI provide unique opportunities to analyze, model and support these interactions. This study proposes an original method to identify group interactions in real-world collaborative learning activities and investigates the variations in interactions of groups with different collaborative learning outcomes. The study was conducted in a 10-week long post-graduate course involving 34 students with data collected from groups’ weekly collaborative learning interactions lasting {\textasciitilde} 60 min per session. The results showed that groups with different levels of shared understanding exhibit significant differences in time spent and maximum duration of referring and following behaviours. Further analysis using process mining techniques revealed that groups with different outcomes exhibit different patterns of group interactions. A loop between students’ referring and following behaviours and resource management behaviours was identified in groups with better collaborative learning outcomes. The study indicates that the nonverbal behaviours studied here, which can be auto-detected with advanced computer vision techniques and multimodal data, have the potential to distinguish groups with different collaborative learning outcomes. Insights generated can also support the practice of collaborative learning for learners and educators. Further research should explore the cross-context validity of the proposed distinctions and explore the approach’s potential to be developed as a real-world, real-time support system for collaborative learning.},

The findings yield valuable insights into how the complex and nonlinear forces of perceived pressure and opportunity push students towards AAD in the classroom. The second objective was to design an original low-effort warning post (WP) in learning management systems and test whether it would reduce AAD based on the perceived psychological costs of being exposed (i.e., being reported to the Office of Student Conduct). We found that WP significantly reduced AAD, thereby contributing to an original deterrence of AAD in the classroom.},

The study employs the extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) to gain a deeper understanding of the factors that affect the acceptance of LMS among workers and how it is affected by the moderating impact of Fear of pandemic and uncertainty avoidance. Data were analyzed using Partial Least Squares (PLS) and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The results of this study indicate that social isolation, price value, and habitat have a significant impact on users’ LMS behavior. Additionally, user behavior is significantly influenced by behavioral intentions. The study also found that coronavirus fears can moderate the relationships between performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, price value, and behavioral intentions. On the other hand, uncertainty avoidance moderates the relationship between performance expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, price value, and behav­ ioral intentions. This study highlights the importance of understanding user acceptance of LMS in order to improve work performance, save time, and eliminate costs. The findings of this study can be used by organi­ zations to develop strategies to increase the acceptance and usage of LMS in the workplace, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study also provides insight into how fear of COVID-19 and uncertainty avoidance can be taken into account when designing and implementing LMS.},

The study followed a pre-test post-test quasi-experimental design in which a total of 43 students were involved. The students took a paper-based reading comprehension test before the training was given to measure their current performance. The Moodle Cloud learning management system was used to train the participants of the study. The training was given twice a week for two months. Data were analyzed using mean, paired samples t-test, Cohen’s d and NVIVO software. It was found that there was a statistically significant difference for inference questions before and after the intervention of web based feedback (t = −10.85, sig. = 0.000 and Cohen’s d = 1.63). Similarly, the mean difference for detail reading questions was statistically significant before and after the use of online elaborative feedback (t = −7.340, sig. = 0.000 and Cohen’s d = 1.11). The mean difference of the main idea questions was also statistically significant (t = −6.443, sig. = 0.000, and Cohen’s d = 0.98). The findings clearly show that students’ reading comprehension sub-skills improved after the treatment of the online elaborative feedback provided to the students. The effect size test conducted using Cohen’s d also indicated that the improvements students made in all the sub-skills tested were quite substantial. Thus, as online elaborative feedback has a considerable contribution to improving students’ reading comprehension skills, instructors are encouraged to facilitate situations for online elaborative feedback for their students.},

	abstract = {Introduction  eLearning has become an essential part of medical education. However, there is a lack of published research on student engagement with online pre-recorded mini-lectures and its relation to assessment. The aim of this pilot study is to explore the relationship between newly introduced neurology pre-recorded mini-lectures and undergraduate medical students engagement and assessment. This may encourage the wider use of mini-lectures in undergraduate medical curricula.
Methods  The engagement of medical students with 48 online pre-recorded neurology mini-lectures was assessed through a Learning Management System. To measure engagement, data was stratified according to the number of watched/downloaded mini-lectures. A point system was used (out of 5): − 1 point = watching/downloading 0–10 mini-lectures, 2 points = watching/downloading 11–20 mini-lectures, 3 points = watching/downloading 21–30 minilectures, 4 points = watching/downloading 31–40 mini-lectures and, 5 points = watching/downloading 41–48 minilectures. The students’ engagement was correlated with their neurology assessments [Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE), and knowledge-based assessment 10 Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) and one 10-mark Short Answer Question, (SAQ)], internal medicine grade and annual grade point average (GPA) using the Pearson correlation coefficient.
Results  The mean engagement of 34, Year 5, medical students is 3.9/5. There is a significant positive correlation between engagement and internal medicine grade (r = 0.35, p = 0.044). There is a moderate correlation between engagement and neurology OSCE (r = 0.23), annual Year 5 GPA (r = 0.23), neurology knowledge-based score (r = 0.22) and composite neurology knowledge/OSCE (r = 0.27). The knowledge-based assessment included SAQ and MCQs: there was a moderate correlation with SAQ (r = 0.30), but a weak negative correlation with the MCQs (r =-0.11). Subgroups analysis comparing the top- and low- or non- engaging students made these weaker correlations stronger.
Conclusion  This pilot study indicates a high rate of engagement with an online pre-recorded mini-lectures resource and evidence of moderate correlation between engagement and assessment. Online pre-recorded mini-lectures should be used more in delivering the curriculum contents of the clinical clerkships. Further studies are needed to evaluate the relation and the impact of the mini-lectures on assessment.},

	abstract = {Higher education institutions (HEI) have realized the advantages of implementing a blended learning environment by using learning management systems (LMSs) to provide effective ways of learning and teaching. However, recent literature has revealed that developing countries’ educational institutions fail when they adopt LMS technologies because they ignore the human factors related to these technologies. This study investigated the impact of human factors on the effectiveness of LMS in a blended learning environment at Kuwait’s HEIs (KHEIs). In this paper, a pragmatic approach consisting of quantitative and qualitative methods is used. User characteristics traits from the literature review were organized into three main indicators of human impact on the effectiveness of LMS: technological characteristics, psychological characteristics, and student-instructor interaction characteristics. After these indicators were identiﬁed, a conceptual model was developed to study the characteristics. A deductive approach was used, and the model was tested for signiﬁcance through receiving feedback from the universities’ students and faculty members. In addition, an inductive approach was implemented through conducting interviews to explore more factors related to the effectiveness of LMS. The inductive approach’s results revealed the relevant factors for the usage of the LMS, such as training, needs, expectations, and branding. The human factors that positively affect the success and effectiveness of LMS included attitude, enjoyment, experience, self-efﬁcacy, and promptness, which had the most substantial impacts on user satisfaction. The modiﬁed conceptual model that this paper presents includes these impacting factors and provides an acceptable ﬁt to the data. This research has developed an updated framework for demonstrating the effectiveness of LMS as it pertains to human factors, and its ﬁndings can be used to enhance user experience in a blended learning environment, thus improving the quality of Kuwaiti education.},

	abstract = {Der Artikel "Was ist eigentlich ein Learning Management System?" von Annette Bouzo bietet eine umfassende Diskussion über Learning Management Systeme (LMS), deren Funktionen und Bedeutung im Kontext der digitalen Bildung. Das Dokument hebt die Schwierigkeiten hervor, eine einheitliche Definition für LMS zu finden, da verschiedene Anbieter und Nutzer unterschiedliche Funktionen und Merkmale hervorheben. 

Ein LMS ist ein komplexes Content-Management-System, das Lerninhalte bereitstellt und Lernvorgänge organisiert. Es dient als Schnittstelle zwischen Bildungsanbietern und Lernenden und unterstützt die Kommunikation zwischen beiden. Typische Funktionen eines LMS umfassen die Erstellung von Inhalten, Kommunikation, Verwaltung von Lerninhalten, Koordination von Lernangeboten und die Beurteilung der Lernenden.

Der Artikel unterscheidet zwischen Lernplattformen und LMS. Eine Lernplattform kann ein einfaches Portal mit Lerninhalten sein, während ein LMS umfangreichere Funktionen wie Benutzerverwaltung, Kursverwaltung, Rollen und Rechte, Kommunikationsmethoden und Werkzeuge sowie Darstellung von Kursinhalten und Lernobjekten bietet. 

Die Autorin betont die Bedeutung des Managements in LMS, das heißt, die Organisation, Verwaltung und (Teil-)Automatisierung von professionellen Lernprozessen. LMS spielt eine wichtige Rolle in der Softwarelandschaft eines Unternehmens, indem es unterschiedliche Anforderungen an die Administration von Qualifizierungsprogrammen und Bildungskampagnen abdeckt.

Zusammenfassend ist ein LMS ein zentraler Bestandteil moderner Bildungs- und Trainingsstrategien, insbesondere in Unternehmenskontexten. Es unterstützt verschiedene Aspekte des Lernprozesses und hilft bei der Organisation, Verwaltung und Bewertung von Lernaktivitäten. Die Vielfalt und Flexibilität von LMS bieten Unternehmen die Möglichkeit, ihre Lern- und Schulungsprozesse effizient und zielgerichtet zu gestalten.},

	abstract = {Zusammenfassung
            Digitale Pflegetechnologien gewinnen in der Langzeitpflege zunehmend an Bedeutung. Sie umfassen alle Technologien, die mittels Vernetzung und/oder Sensorik Prozesse und/oder Produkte verändern, und schließen künstliche Intelligenz, also Verfahren, Methoden und Algorithmen, um mittels Daten zu lernen und darauf aufbauend zielorientierte Handlungen zu ermöglichen, ein. Ihre Anwendung reicht von der Förderung professioneller Zusammenarbeit über Steuerung und Verwaltung, Wissenserwerb und -weitergabe, Interaktion und Beziehung bis zur körpernahen Pflege.
            Digitale Pflegetechnologien haben das Potenzial, gleichzeitig die Qualität der Pflege zu erhöhen und die Arbeitsbedingungen in der Pflege zu verbessern. Allerdings stehen dem Hemmnisse auf verschiedenen Ebenen entgegen: Die Entwicklung dieser Technologien wird häufig von den technischen Möglichkeiten getrieben, sodass Produkte entstehen, die im Pflegealltag keinen konkreten Nutzen entfalten. Bei der Implementation wird nur die Bedienung geschult; es erfolgt aber keine Organisationsentwicklung zur systematischen Integration der Technologien in den Arbeitsalltag. Zudem fehlen hochwertige Evaluationen, die den tatsächlichen Nutzen im Arbeitsalltag abbilden, um so potenzielle Anwender:innen für die Technologie zu gewinnen. Schließlich ist die nachhaltige Finanzierung, insbesondere der Unterhaltung dieser Technologien, nicht gesichert.
            Eine gelingende Digitalisierung in der Pflege setzt daher voraus, dass Technikentwickler:innen und -anwender:innen ebenso wie Politik und Wissenschaft gemeinsam diese Hemmnisse überwinden. Das impliziert, dass Pflegende von Anfang an in den Entwicklungsprozess einbezogen sind, aber auch dass Orte geschaffen werden, in denen die Wirkung digitaler Pflegetechnologien im tatsächlichen Versorgungsgeschehen evaluiert werden kann.

            Abstract
            Digital care technologies are becoming increasingly important in long-term care. They encompass all technologies that change processes and products by means of networking and/or sensor technology and include artificial intelligence, that is, processes, methods, and algorithms for learning by means of data and enabling meaningful decisions based on this. Their application ranges from the promotion of professional collaboration, control and management, knowledge acquisition and transfer, interaction and relationships to physical caregiving.
            Digital care technologies have the potential to simultaneously increase the quality of care and improve working conditions in care. However, there are obstacles to this at various levels: The development of these technologies is often driven by technical possibilities, resulting in products that do not provide any concrete benefits in routine nursing care. During implementation, only the operator is trained; however, there is no organizational development for the systematic integration of these technologies into routine work. In addition, there is a lack of high-quality evaluations showing evidence of the actual benefits to routine work in order to attract potential users to these technologies. Finally, there is no sustainable financing, especially for the maintenance of these technologies.
            Successful digitization in long-term care therefore requires that technology developers and users, as well as policymakers and scientists, jointly overcome these obstacles. This implies that caregivers are involved in the development process from the outset (co-creation) but also that spaces are created where the effect of digital care technologies can be evaluated in routine caregiving.},

Senior medical students are being incrementally deployed to the front line to address the shortage of certified physicians. These students, some of whom will be fast-tracked as physicians, may lack knowledge regarding the initial management of time-critical emergencies such as stroke. Objective: Our aim was to determine whether an e-learning module could improve asynchronous distance knowledge acquisition of the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) in senior medical students compared to the traditional didactic video. Methods: A randomized, data analyst?blinded web-based trial was conducted at the University of Geneva Faculty of Medicine between April and June 2020. Fifth year medical students followed a distance learning path designed to teach the NIHSS. The control group followed the traditional didactic video created by Patrick Lyden, while the e-learning group followed the updated version of a previously tested, highly interactive e-learning module. The main outcome was the score on a 50-question quiz displayed upon completion of the learning material. The difference in the proportion of correct answers for each specific NIHSS item was also assessed. Results: Out of 158 potential participants, 88 started their allocated learning path and 75 completed the trial. Participants who followed the e-learning module performed better than those who followed the video (38 correct answers, 95\% CI 37-39, vs 35 correct answers, 95\% CI 34-36, P{\textless}.001). Participants in the e-learning group scored better on five elements than the video group: key NIHSS concepts (P=.02), the consciousness ? global item (P{\textless}.001), the facial palsy item (P=.04), the ataxia item (P=.03), and the sensory item (P=.04). Conclusions: Compared to the traditional didactic video, a highly interactive e-learning module enhances asynchronous distance learning and NIHSS knowledge acquisition in senior medical students.},

	abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated clinicians to transition to telehealth, often with little preparation or training. The Physiotherapy Exercise and Physical Activity for Knee Osteoarthritis (PEAK) e-learning modules were developed to upskill physiotherapists in management of knee osteoarthritis (OA) via telehealth and in-person. In the research setting, the e-learning modules are perceived by physiotherapists as effective when they are part of a comprehensive training program for a clinical trial. However, the effectiveness of the modules on their own in a real-world setting is unknown.
Objective: This study aims to evaluate the reach, effectiveness, adoption, and implementation of PEAK e-learning modules.
Methods: This longitudinal study was informed by the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. Participants were clinicians, researchers, educators, and health care students who registered for access to the modules between April 1 and November 30, 2020. Reach was evaluated by outcomes (countries, referral sources, and attrition) extracted from registration data and embedded within precourse surveys in the Learning Management System (LMS). Effectiveness was evaluated by outcomes (confidence with videoconferencing; likelihood of using education, strengthening exercise, and physical activity in a treatment plan for knee OA; usefulness of modules) measured using a 10-point numeric rating scale (NRS; score range from 1=not confident or likely or useful at all to 10=extremely confident or likely or useful) in pre- and postcourse (on completion) surveys in the LMS. Adoption and implementation were evaluated by demographic and professional characteristics and outcomes related to the use of learning and usefulness of program elements (measured via a 4-point Likert scale, from not at all useful to extremely useful) in a survey administered 4 months after module completion.
Results: Broad reach was achieved, with 6720 people from 97 countries registering for access. Among registrants, there were high levels of attrition, with 36.65\% (2463/6720) commencing the program and precourse survey and 19.61\% (1318/6720) completing all modules and the postcourse survey. The program was effective. Learners who completed the modules demonstrated increased confidence with videoconferencing (mean change 3.1, 95\% CI 3.0-3.3 NRS units) and increased likelihood of using education, strengthening and physical activity in a knee OA treatment plan, compared to precourse. Adoption and implementation of learning (n=149 respondents) occurred at 4 months. More than half of the respondents used their learning to structure in-person consultations with patients (80/142, 56.3\%) and patient information booklets in their clinical practice (75/142, 52.8\%).
Conclusions: Findings provide evidence of the reach and effectiveness of an asynchronous self-directed e-learning program in a real-world setting among physiotherapists. The e-learning modules offer clinicians an accessible educational course to learn},

	abstract = {Background  Over the last decade, developments in e-Learning and technologies are creating the groundwork for health sciences and medical education. Literature demonstrates that we have yet to reach any form of consensus about which indicators are needed to assess and teach quality health sciences and medical education through technology or innovation. There is, therefore, a greater need for a tool or platform that is properly constructed, validated and tested within health sciences.
Methods  This paper presents a study, which is part of a larger research project assessing staff and students’ perceptions of the importance and relevance of different aspects of e-Learning and mHealth in health sciences curricula at four universities in South Africa. The specific objectives of this study were to: (i) assess health sciences staffs’ perceptions and understanding of these two applications; and (ii) establish challenges and opportunities of e-Learning and mHealth applications in the health sector, as well as perceptions on the importance and relevance of these applications to their curricula and future practices. A combination of Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) and a key-informant interview was used. A total of 19 staff from four universities participated. Atlast.ti was used for the data analysis and the findings were coded using a primarily deductive thematic coding framework.
Results  The findings revealed that not all staff members are equipped or trained with new applications or technologies, such as mHealth. Most participants believed that diverse technologies and tools could be integrated with mHealth and e-Learning. Furthermore, participants agree that a new multi-modal platform, in the form of a learning management system (LMS) with relevant applications (and possible plugins) integrated, tailored towards health sciences will benefit all stakeholders, and be valuable to higher education and health sectors.
Conclusions  Digitalisation as well as digital citizenship is gradually being integrated into teaching and learning. It is imperative to adapt the health sciences curricula through constructive alignments and promote health sciences education in the current 4IR. This would allow graduates to be better prepared for digitalised practice environments.},

	abstract = {Armed conflict is an evolution in reverse that significantly damages infrastructure, displaces students and faculty, and limits access to resources, necessitating innovative solutions. This research uses Syria as a case study to investigate the potential of a digital transformation strategy to revitalize the higher education system in warravaged regions. It proposes a digital transformation framework utilizing a mixed-method approach, including literature reviews, expert interviews, and case analysis, to identify critical challenges faced by Syrian higher education institutions. The framework focuses on developing digital infrastructure, capacity building for edu­ cators, e-learning platforms, digital content, and public-private partnerships that increase education access, foster collaboration, enable remote learning and enhance global competitiveness in war-torn areas. The elearning platforms component explores the potential of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), Learning Management Systems (LMS), and blended learning approaches to enhance the quality and accessibility of higher education. The digital content component highlights the importance of open educational resources, digital li­ braries, and virtual labs to support learning. Finally, the capacity building component addresses the need for training and upskilling educators and administrators to implement digital solutions effectively. The proposed framework is a roadmap for policymakers, educators, and international organizations to develop and implement digital solutions supporting long-term recovery and growth in conflict-affected areas.},

	abstract = {Up to 56 million young and adult women of African origin suffer from Female Genital Schistosomiasis (FGS). The transmission of schistosomiasis happens through contact with schistosomiasis infested fresh water in rivers and lakes. The transmission vector is the snail that releases immature worms capable of penetrating the human skin. The worm then matures and mates in the blood vessels and deposits its eggs in tissues, causing urogenital disease. There is currently no gold standard for FGS diagnosis. Reliable diagnostics are challenging due to the lack of appropriate instruments and clinical skills. The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends "screen-and-treat" cervical cancer management, by means of visual inspection of characteristic lesions on the cervix and point-of-care treatment as per the findings. FGS may be mistaken for cervical cancer or sexually transmitted diseases. Misdiagnosis may lead to the wrong treatment, increased risk of exposure to other infectious diseases (human immunodeficiency virus and human papilloma virus), infertility and stigmatisation. The necessary clinical knowledge is only available to a few experts in the world. For an appropriate diagnosis, this knowledge needs to be transferred to health professionals who have minimal or non-existing laboratory support. Co-design workshops were held with stakeholders (WHO representative, national health authority, FGS experts and researchers, gynaecologists, nurses, medical doctors, public health experts, technical experts, and members of the public) to make prototypes for the WHO Pocket Atlas for FGS, a mobile diagnostic support tool and an e-learning tool for health professionals. The dissemination targeted health facilities, including remote areas across the 51 anglophone, francophone and lusophone African countries. Outcomes were endorsed by the WHO and comprise a practical diagnostic guide for FGS in low-resource environments.},

The paper presents a study in which dropout predictions were calculated based on campus management data of 4601 student teachers. Two machine learning methods, logistic regression and random forest, were used and their application and results are presented. With both methods, all students could be correctly assigned to either the group of successful graduates or dropouts with about 80\% accuracy. The most important predictor was the examination performance in the ﬁrst three semesters (grade and percentage of passed examinations).

Coursework over this 31-day span included lessons on cytology, histology, the integumentary system, and osteology; we observed the timing and frequency of students’ use of the lecture outline, ungraded self-testing quizzes, and hypothesized that those who self-regulated by downloading advance organizers before lecture (i.e., pre-reading) and utilizing quizzes to self-test (i.e., retrieval practice) and distributed this practice would achieve superior performances. Whereas students massed self-testing prior to the exam, a regression model that also included pre-reading, self-testing, and its distribution predicted achievement over and above massed practice. In authentic contexts, students used digital resources and benefitted from early lecture access or pre-reading advance organizers, and self-testing despite challenges to distribute practice and to self-test frequently and on recommended schedules.},

              Hintergrund
              Die COVID-19(„coronavirus disease 2019“)-Pandemie hat die Ad-hoc-Digitalisierung an Hochschulen vorangetrieben. Zugleich stand die digitale Hochschullehre vor der Herausforderung der Ausgestaltung der Lehre im Zusammenhang mit den vorbestehenden Ressourcen, der digitalen und didaktischen Kompetenzen sowie der zur Verfügung stehenden technischen Infrastruktur.
            
            
              Ziel der Arbeit/Fragestellung
              Das Ziel der Umfrage war die Einschätzung der digitalen Lehre, die die Präsenzlehre infolge der COVID-19-Pandemie zum großen Teil bzw. gänzlich ersetzt hat, aus der Perspektive der Lehrenden in Public Health, Medizin und Pflege.
            
            
              Material und Methode
              
                Die Querschnitterhebung fand online von Juni bis August 2020 statt und die Daten wurden über
                www.soscisurvey.de
                erhoben. Die schriftliche Befragung wurde unter Mitgliedern der Deutschen Gesellschaft für Public Health (DGPH) und des Ausschusses Digitalisierung der Gesellschaft für medizinische Ausbildung (GMA) und der Sektionen Bildung und Beratung der Deutschen Gesellschaft für Pflegewissenschaft (DGP) sowie der Arbeitsgruppe Lehre der Deutschen Gesellschaft für Medizinische Soziologie (DGMS) durchgeführt (
                n
                 = 100).
              
            
            
              Ergebnisse
              Bei der Nutzung der digitalen Technologien in den Veranstaltungen rangieren auf der obersten Stelle Präsentationstools, gefolgt von Lernmanagementsystemen, Videoangeboten sowie digitalen Texten. Die Teilnehmenden geben hinsichtlich der Nutzung unterschiedliche (Konferenz‑)Tools an. Das Erstellen von Lehrvideos bejahen 53 \% der Befragten, Abstimmungstools) werden bis {\textgreater} 50 \% als unbekannt genannt. Als Herausforderungen werden digitale Infrastruktur der Hochschulen, fehlende didaktische Beratung/Unterstützung sowie rechtliche Fragen (Nutzungsrechte, Datenschutz) angegeben.
            
            
              Schlussfolgerung
              Neue Technologie werden vorwiegend für Wissenserwerb, Wissensvermittlung genutzt, selten zur Aktivierung von Studierenden und zur Gestaltung kollaborativer Lehr- und Lernarrangements sowie Neugestaltung von Lernaufgaben und Lernprozessen (individualisiertes Lernen). Welche der aktuell erprobten digitalen Lehr- und Lernformate zukünftig in der Hochschullehre zunehmend eingesetzt werden, hängt von vielen Faktoren ab, u. a. von digitaler Kompetenz sowie der Bereitschaft der Lehrenden und Lernenden die digitale Lernkultur mitzugestalten.

            Abstract
            
              Background
              The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has driven the digitisation in higher education institutions. At the same time, digital higher education teaching faced the challenge of designing teaching in the context of pre-existing resources, digital and didactic skills, and available technical infrastructure.
            
            
              Objective
              The aim of the survey was to assess the assessment/evaluation of digital teaching, which has largely or completely replaced face-to-face teaching as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, from the perspective of lecturers in public health, medicine and nursing.
            
            
              Materials and methods
              
                The cross-sectional survey took place online from June to August 2020 and data were collected via www.soscisurvey. The written survey was conducted among members of the German Society for Public Health (DGPH) and the Digitisation Committee of the Society for Medical Education (GMA) and the Education and Counselling Sections of the German Society for Nursing Science (DGP), and the Teaching Working Group of the German Society for Medical Sociology (DGMS) (
                n
                 = 100).
              
            
            
              Results
              In terms of the use of digital technologies in the courses, presentation tools ranked first, followed by learning management systems, video content and digital texts. With regard to the use of tools, participants most frequently mentioned various video conference tools). The creation of instructional videos was affirmed by 53\% of the respondents; voting tools were mentioned as unknown by over 50\%. Digital infrastructure of the universities, lack of didactic advice/support and legal questions (rights of use, data protection) were cited as challenges.
            
            
              Conclusion
              New technology is mainly used for knowledge acquisition, knowledge transfer, rarely for activating students and designing collaborative teaching and learning arrangements as well as redesigning learning tasks and learning processes (individualised learning). Which of the currently tested digital teaching and learning formats will be increasingly used in university teaching in the future depends on many factors, including digital competence and the willingness of teachers and students to help develop the digital learning culture.},

Trotz Campusschliessungen konnten die Befragten ihr Studium weitgehend wie geplant fortführen. Während die technische Ausstattung der Studierenden eine Teilnahme an digitalen Lehrveranstaltungen zuliess, zeigten sich Defizite bei der Qualität der Internetverbindung. Im Vergleich zum Vorsemester wurden die Studienorganisation als moderat (d = -0.48, 95 \% CI [-0.52, -0.45]), Lernaktivitäten als deutlich (d = -0.86, 95 \% CI [-0.90, -0.82]) schwerer empfunden. Auch die Konzentration auf das Studium fiel den Befragten schwerer als im Semester davor (d = -0.69, 95 \% CI [-0.72, -0.65]). Mit den angebotenen Lernmedien zeigten sich die Befragten tendenziell zufrieden. Vor allem Learning-Management-Systeme, digitale Texte und Präsentationen dominierten das Lerngeschehen an den sächsischen Hochschulen. Fehlende soziale Interaktionen mit Peers und fehlende lernbezogene Interaktionen mit Dozentinnen und Dozenten wurden als besonders nachteilig erlebt. Zeit- und Kostenersparnisse sowie mehr Autonomie beim Lernen sind die grössten Vorteile des Studierens von zu Hause. Es zeigen sich keine Hinweise, dass leistungsschwache Studierende von den veränderten Studienbedingungen stärker nachteilig betroffen waren.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: COVID pandemic shifted healthcare-related education to digital platforms. With the widespread availability of learning management systems like MOODLE, many opportunities exist to create innovative e-modules. Its success depends on the interactive multimedia resources and structural framework. The present study aims to create two patient-centric e-modules on Diabetes and Alcoholic liver disease in Pathology by a medical undergraduate facilitated by faculty and to assess its impact on learning outcomes and learners' perceptions in relation to student seminars.
METHODOLOGY: This mixed-method intervention study combines quantitative and qualitative research methods to gain deeper insight into learners' experiences. By random allocation, half of the second-year medical undergraduates (n = 60) attended an e-module, and the other half listened to a student seminar on the same topic with the same specific learning objectives. Pre- and post-test scores and feedback questionnaires were quantitatively analysed. Student-led focus group discussions (FGD) for learners' experiences underwent thematic analysis.
RESULTS: Pre- and post-tests for both learning techniques were statistically significant, while the feedback questionnaire's responses favoured e-module. Four focus group discussions yielded six themes for the e-module: Patient-driven holistic learning experience, Inquiry-based learning, Immersive learning, Higher level cognitive skills, Flexibility, repeatability and accessibility, and No human involvement. The five themes for the seminar were: Peer-driven camaraderie learning dynamic, Teacher-centric synchronous learning, Active vs passive listening, Basic learning, and Teacher-student interaction.
CONCLUSION: While both learning techniques had comparable effects on test scores, they have merits and demerits. Hence, blending both techniques where seminars impart basic knowledge and e-module for deeper reinforcement will benefit the students.},

	abstract = {Background: Web-based digital repositories allow educational resources to be accessed efficiently and conveniently from diverse geographic locations, hold a variety of resource formats, enable interactive learning, and facilitate targeted access for the user. Unlike some other learning management systems (LMS), resources can be retrieved through search engines and meta-tagged labels, and content can be streamed, which is particularly useful for multimedia resources.
Objective: The aim of this study was to examine usage and user experiences of an online learning repository (Physeek) in a population of physiotherapy students. The secondary aim of this project was to examine how students prefer to access resources and which resources they find most helpful.
Methods: The following data were examined using an audit of the repository server: (1) number of online resources accessed per day in 2010, (2) number of each type of resource accessed, (3) number of resources accessed during business hours (9 am to 5 pm) and outside business hours (years 1-4), (4) session length of each log-on (years 1-4), and (5) video quality (bit rate) of each video accessed. An online questionnaire and 3 focus groups assessed student feedback and self-reported experiences of Physeek.
Results: Students preferred the support provided by Physeek to other sources of educational material primarily because of its efficiency. Peak usage commonly occurred at times of increased academic need (ie, examination times). Students perceived online repositories as a potential tool to support lifelong learning and health care delivery.
Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that today’s health professional students welcome the benefits of online learning resources because of their convenience and usability. This represents a transition away from traditional learning styles and toward technological learning support and may indicate a growing link between social immersions in Internet-based connections and learning styles. The true potential for Web-based resources to support student learning is as yet unknown.},

We refer to platforms that were designed to permit for mathematical communication between multiple users. We seek to explore the affordances of such digital platforms to support mathematics teachers who wish to integrate technology as part of their practice, when planning and enacting technology-based mathematical activity. Specifically, we ask: What are the affordances and constraints of the platforms that may support instrumentation and instrumentalization processes leading to the development of teacher’s didactic instrument for planning and enacting a mathematical activity in a digital environment? The four platforms we chose for analysis are STEP, DESMOS, WIMS and Labomep. Our analysis shows on the one hand that the platforms afford support to the teacher while enacting technology-based mathematics activities. On the other hand, we suggest several components of didactic instrumental genesis that mathematics teachers need to develop in order to take benefit from digital platform affordances. These components include the ability to base decision-making on data gathered and visualised in dashboard embedded in learning management systems.},

We illustrate, using the example of Digital.Campus Bayern, an initiative of the Bavarian State Ministry of Digital Affairs, how a learning platform can promote the foundations for self-organization and independent problem-solving. The goal of Digital.Campus Bayern is to support all employees of public administration in Bavaria through ﬂexible and innovative learning opportunities to successfully overcome the challenges of digital transformation. The platform consists of a search function, a system for managing learning content, and a diagnostic tool. Particularly noteworthy is the diagnostic tool, which provides individual learning paths for the development of digital competencies. This tool serves as the central component of the entire learning platform.

	abstract = {Background: Blended learning describes a combination of teaching methods, often utilizing digital technologies. Research suggests that learner outcomes can be improved through some blended learning formats. However, the cost-effectiveness of delivering blended learning is unclear.
Objective: This study aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of a face-to-face learning and blended learning approach for evidence-based medicine training within a medical program.
Methods: The economic evaluation was conducted as part of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the evidence-based medicine (EBM) competency of medical students who participated in two different modes of education delivery. In the traditional face-to-face method, students received ten 2-hour classes. In the blended learning approach, students received the same total face-to-face hours but with different activities and additional online and mobile learning. Online activities utilized YouTube and a library guide indexing electronic databases, guides, and books. Mobile learning involved self-directed interactions with patients in their regular clinical placements. The attribution and differentiation of costs between the interventions within the RCT was measured in conjunction with measured outcomes of effectiveness. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated comparing the ongoing operation costs of each method with the level of EBM proficiency achieved. Present value analysis was used to calculate the break-even point considering the transition cost and the difference in ongoing operation cost.
Results: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio indicated that it costs 24\% less to educate a student to the same level of EBM competency via the blended learning approach used in the study, when excluding transition costs. The sunk cost of approximately AUD \$40,000 to transition to the blended model exceeds any savings from using the approach within the first year of its implementation; however, a break-even point is achieved within its third iteration and relative savings in the subsequent years. The sensitivity analysis indicates that approaches with higher transition costs, or staffing requirements over that of a traditional method, are likely to result in negative value propositions.
Conclusions: Under the study conditions, a blended learning approach was more cost-effective to operate and resulted in improved value for the institution after the third year iteration, when compared to the traditional face-to-face model. The wider applicability of the findings are dependent on the type of blended learning utilized, staffing expertise, and educational context.},

Despite the rapid adoption of AI and machine learning (ML) in other domains and industry, deployment in medical research and clinical practice poses several challenges due to the inherent characteristics and barriers of the healthcare sector. Therefore, researchers aiming to perform AI-intensive studies require a fundamental understanding of the key concepts, biases, and clinical safety concerns associated with the use of AI. Through the analysis of large, multimodal datasets, AI has the potential to revolutionize orthopaedic research, with new insights regarding the optimal diagnosis and management of patients affected musculoskeletal injury and disease. The article is the first in a series introducing fundamental concepts and best practices to guide healthcare professionals and researcher interested in performing AI-intensive orthopaedic research studies. The vast potential of AI in orthopaedics is illustrated through examples involving disease- or injury-specific outcome prediction, medical image analysis, clinical decision support systems and digital twin technology. Furthermore, it is essential to address the role of human involvement in training unbiased, generalizable AI models, their explainability in high-risk clinical settings and the implementation of expert oversight and clinical safety measures for failure. In conclusion, the opportunities and challenges of AI in medicine are presented to ensure the safe and ethical deployment of AI models for orthopaedic research and clinical application.

This is particularly important in the combat casualty care setting when a single casualty may be treated by four or more or five completely disparate teams across the roles of care. The Battlefield Assisted Trauma Distributed Observation Kit (BATDOK) is a digital battlefield clinical documentation system developed by the Air Force Research Laboratory to address this need. To support the deployment of this tool, we integrated BATDOK into a commercially available virtual reality (VR) medical simulation platform used by the U.S. Air Force and Defense Health Agency personnel in order to provide an immersive simulation training experience which included battlefield documentation.
METHODS: A multidisciplinary team consisting of medical educators, VR simulation engineers, emergency physicians and pararescuemen, and BATDOK developers first developed a specification for a virtual BATDOK capability, including a detailed listing of learning objectives, critical interfaces and task plans, and sensor integrations. These specifications were then implemented into the commercially available Virtual Advancement of Learning for Operational Readiness VR Medical Simulation System and underwent developmental testing and evaluation during pararescueman training exercises at the Air Force Special Operations Command Special Operations Center for Medical Integration and Development.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The BATDOK capability was successfully implemented within the VR Medical Simulation System. The capability consisted of a virtual tablet with replicated interfaces and capabilities based on the developed specifications. These capabilities included integrated point-of-care ultrasound capability, multi-patient management, vitals sign monitoring with sensor pairing and continuous monitoring, mechanism of injury documentation (including injury pattern documentation), intervention logging (including tourniquets, dressing, airways, lines, tubes and drains, splints, fluids, and medications), and event logging. The capability was found to be operational and in alignment with learning objectives and user acceptance goals.},

A linear regression analysis was used to identify the influence of the year of medical studies on the responses. Additional analysis was performed by grouping the responses by the self-evaluated frequency of eHealth technology use. Written responses to four qualitative questions in the survey were analyzed using an inductive approach.
Results: The survey received a total of 451 responses from 39 European countries, and there were respondents for every year of medical studies. The majority of respondents saw advantages in the use of digital health. While 40.6\% (183/451) felt prepared to work in a digitized health care system, more than half (240/451, 53.2\%) evaluated their eHealth skills as poor or very poor. Medical students considered lack of education to be the reason for this, with 84.9\% (383/451) agreeing or strongly agreeing that more digital health education should be implemented in the medical curriculum. Students demanded introductory and specific eHealth courses covering data management, ethical aspects, legal frameworks, research and entrepreneurial opportunities, role in public health and health systems, communication skills, and practical training. The emphasis lay on tailoring learning to future job requirements and interprofessional education.
Conclusions: This study shows a lack of digital health-related formats in medical education and a perceived lack of digital health literacy among European medical students. Our findings indicate a gap between the willingness of medical students to take an active role by becoming key players in the digital transformation of health care and the education that they receive through their faculties.},

	abstract = {Background: Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death from a single infectious agent, with around 1.5 million deaths reported in 2018, and is a major contributor to suffering worldwide, with an estimated 10 million new cases every year. In the context of the World Health Organization’s End TB strategy and the quest for digital innovations, there is a need to understand what is happening around the world regarding research into the use of digital technology for better TB care and control.
Objective: The purpose of this scoping review was to summarize the state of research on the use of digital technology to enhance TB care and control. This study provides an overview of publications covering this subject and answers 3 main questions: (1) to what extent has the issue been addressed in the scientific literature between January 2016 and March 2019, (2) which countries have been investing in research in this field, and (3) what digital technologies were used?
Methods: A Web-based search was conducted on PubMed and Web of Science. Studies that describe the use of digital technology with specific reference to keywords such as TB, digital health, eHealth, and mHealth were included. Data from selected studies were synthesized into 4 functions using narrative and graphical methods. Such digital health interventions were categorized based on 2 classifications, one by function and the other by targeted user.
Results: A total of 145 relevant studies were identified out of the 1005 published between January 2016 and March 2019. Overall, 72.4\% (105/145) of the research focused on patient care and 20.7\% (30/145) on surveillance and monitoring. Other programmatic functions 4.8\% (7/145) and electronic learning 2.1\% (3/145) were less frequently studied. Most digital health technologies used for patient care included primarily diagnostic 59.4\% (63/106) and treatment adherence tools 40.6\% (43/106). On the basis of the second type of classification, 107 studies targeted health care providers (107/145, 73.8\%), 20 studies targeted clients (20/145, 13.8\%), 17 dealt with data services (17/145, 11.7\%), and 1 study was on the health system or resource management. The first authors’ affiliations were mainly from 3 countries: the United States (30/145 studies, 20.7\%), China (20/145 studies, 13.8\%), and India (17/145 studies, 11.7\%). The researchers from the United States conducted their research both domestically and abroad, whereas researchers from China and India conducted all studies domestically.
Conclusions: The majority of research conducted between January 2016 and March 2019 on digital interventions for TB focused on diagnostic tools and treatment adherence technologies, such as video-observed therapy and SMS. Only a few studies addressed interventions for data services and health system or resource management.},

	abstract = {Background: Tobacco smoking, one of the leading causes of preventable death and disease, is associated with 7 million deaths every year. This is estimated to rise to more than 8 million deaths per year by 2030, with 80\% occurring in low- and middle-income countries. Digital education, teaching, and learning using digital technologies have the potential to increase educational opportunities, supplement teaching activities, and decrease distance barriers in health professions education.
Objective: The primary objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness of digital education compared with various controls in improving learners’ knowledge, skills, attitudes, and satisfaction to deliver smoking cessation therapy. The secondary objectives were to assess patient-related outcomes, change in health professionals’ practice or behavior, self-efficacy or self-rated competence of health professionals in delivering smoking cessation therapy, and cost-effectiveness of the interventions.
Methods: We searched 7 electronic databases and 2 trial registers for randomized controlled trials published between January 1990 and August 2017. We used gold standard Cochrane methods to select and extract data and appraise eligible studies.
Results: A total of 11 studies (number of participants, n=2684) were included in the review. All studies found that digital education was at least as effective as traditional or usual learning. There was some suggestion that blended education results in similar or greater improvements in knowledge (standardized mean difference, SMD=0.19, 95\% CI −0.35 to 0.72), skill (SMD=0.58, 95\% CI 0.08-1.08), and satisfaction (SMD=0.62, 95\% CI 0.12-1.12) compared with digital education or usual learning alone. There was also some evidence for improved attitude (SMD=0.45, 95\% CI 0.18-0.72) following digital education compared with usual learning. Only 1 study reported patient outcomes and the setup cost of blended education but did not compare outcomes among groups. There were insufficient data to investigate what components of the digital education interventions were associated with the greatest improvements in learning outcomes.
Conclusions: The evidence suggests that digital education is at least as effective as usual learning in improving health professionals’ knowledge and skill for delivering smoking cessation therapy. However, limitations in the evidence base mean that these conclusions should be interpreted with some caution.},

	abstract = {Background: There is a shortage of health care professionals competent in diabetes management worldwide. Digital education is increasingly used in educating health professionals on diabetes. Digital diabetes self-management education for patients has been shown to improve patients’ knowledge and outcomes. However, the effectiveness of digital education on diabetes management for health care professionals is still unknown.
Objective: The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness and economic impact of digital education in improving health care professionals’ knowledge, skills, attitudes, satisfaction, and competencies. We also assessed its impact on patient outcomes and health care professionals’ behavior.
Methods: We included randomized controlled trials evaluating the impact of digitalized diabetes management education for health care professionals pre- and postregistration. Publications from 1990 to 2017 were searched in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ERIC, and Web of Science. Screening, data extraction and risk of bias assessment were conducted independently by 2 authors.
Results: A total of 12 studies met the inclusion criteria. Studies were heterogeneous in terms of digital education modality, comparators, outcome measures, and intervention duration. Most studies comparing digital or blended education to traditional education reported significantly higher knowledge and skills scores in the intervention group. There was little or no between-group difference in patient outcomes or economic impact. Most studies were judged at a high or unclear risk of bias.
Conclusions: Digital education seems to be more effective than traditional education in improving diabetes management–related knowledge and skills. The paucity and low quality of the available evidence call for urgent and well-designed studies focusing on important outcomes such as health care professionals’ behavior, patient outcomes, and cost-effectiveness as well as its impact in diverse settings, including developing countries.},

	abstract = {Background: As a modern pedagogical philosophy, problem-based learning (PBL) is increasingly being recognized as a major research area in student learning and pedagogical innovation in health sciences education. A new area of research interest has been the role of emerging educational technologies in PBL. Although this field is growing, no systematic reviews of studies of the usage and effects of educational technologies in PBL in health sciences education have been conducted to date.
Objective: The aim of this paper is to review new and emerging educational technologies in problem-based curricula, with a specific focus on 3 cognate clinical disciplines: medicine, dentistry, and speech and hearing sciences. Analysis of the studies reviewed focused on the effects of educational technologies in PBL contexts while addressing the particular issue of scaffolding of student learning.
Methods: A comprehensive computerized database search of full-text articles published in English from 1996 to 2014 was carried out using 3 databases: ProQuest, Scopus, and EBSCOhost. Eligibility criteria for selection of studies for review were also determined in light of the population, intervention, comparison, and outcomes (PICO) guidelines. The population was limited to postsecondary education, specifically in dentistry, medicine, and speech and hearing sciences, in which PBL was the key educational pedagogy and curriculum design. Three types of educational technologies were identified as interventions used to support student inquiry: learning software and digital learning objects; interactive whiteboards (IWBs) and plasma screens; and learning management systems (LMSs).
Results: Of 470 studies, 28 were selected for analysis. Most studies examined the effects of learning software and digital learning objects (n=20) with integration of IWB (n=5) and LMS (n=3) for PBL receiving relatively less attention. The educational technologies examined in these studies were seen as potentially fit for problem-based health sciences education. Positive outcomes for student learning included providing rich, authentic problems and/or case contexts for learning; supporting student development of medical expertise through the accessing and structuring of expert knowledge and skills; making disciplinary thinking and strategies explicit; providing a platform to elicit articulation, collaboration, and reflection; and reducing perceived cognitive load. Limitations included cumbersome scenarios, infrastructure requirements, and the need for staff and student support in light of the technological demands of new affordances.
Conclusions: This literature review demonstrates the generally positive effect of educational technologies in PBL. Further research into the various applications of educational technology in PBL curricula is needed to fully realize its potential to enhance problem-based approaches in health sciences education.},

	abstract = {Background: Handheld computers and mobile devices provide instant access to vast amounts and types of useful information for health care professionals. Their reduced size and increased processing speed has led to rapid adoption in health care. Thus, it is important to identify whether handheld computers are actually effective in clinical practice.
Objective: A scoping review of systematic reviews was designed to provide a quick overview of the documented evidence of effectiveness for health care professionals using handheld computers in their clinical work.
Methods: A detailed search, sensitive for systematic reviews was applied for Cochrane, Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), Global Health, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) databases. All outcomes that demonstrated effectiveness in clinical practice were included. Classroom learning and patient use of handheld computers were excluded. Quality was assessed using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) tool. A previously published conceptual framework was used as the basis for dual data extraction. Reported outcomes were summarized according to the primary function of the handheld computer.
Results: Five systematic reviews met the inclusion and quality criteria. Together, they reviewed 138 unique primary studies. Most reviewed descriptive intervention studies, where physicians, pharmacists, or medical students used personal digital assistants. Effectiveness was demonstrated across four distinct functions of handheld computers: patient documentation, patient care, information seeking, and professional work patterns. Within each of these functions, a range of positive outcomes were reported using both objective and self-report measures. The use of handheld computers improved patient documentation through more complete recording, fewer documentation errors, and increased efficiency. Handheld computers provided easy access to clinical decision support systems and patient management systems, which improved decision making for patient care. Handheld computers saved time and gave earlier access to new information. There were also reports that handheld computers enhanced work patterns and efficiency.
Conclusions: This scoping review summarizes the secondary evidence for effectiveness of handheld computers and mhealth. It provides a snapshot of effective use by health care professionals across four key functions. We identified evidence to suggest that handheld computers provide easy and timely access to information and enable accurate and complete documentation. Further, they can give health care professionals instant access to evidence-based decision support and patient management systems to improve clinical decision making. Finally, there is evidence that handheld computers allow health professionals to be more},

	abstract = {Background: Medical Faculties Network (MEFANET) has established itself as the authority for setting standards for medical educators in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, 2 independent countries with similar languages that once comprised a federation and that still retain the same curricular structure for medical education. One of the basic goals of the network is to advance medical teaching and learning with the use of modern information and communication technologies.
Objective: We present the education portal AKUTNE.CZ as an important part of the MEFANET’s content. Our focus is primarily on simulation-based tools for teaching and learning acute medicine issues.
Methods: Three fundamental elements of the MEFANET e-publishing system are described: (1) medical disciplines linker, (2) authentication/authorization framework, and (3) multidimensional quality assessment. A new set of tools for technology-enhanced learning have been introduced recently: Sandbox (works in progress), WikiLectures (collaborative content authoring), Moodle-MEFANET (central learning management system), and Serious Games (virtual casuistics and interactive algorithms). The latest development in MEFANET is designed for indexing metadata about simulation-based learning objects, also known as electronic virtual patients or virtual clinical cases. The simulations assume the form of interactive algorithms for teaching and learning acute medicine. An anonymous questionnaire of 10 items was used to explore students’ attitudes and interests in using the interactive algorithms as part of their medical or health care studies. Data collection was conducted over 10 days in February 2013.
Results: In total, 25 interactive algorithms in the Czech and English languages have been developed and published on the AKUTNE.CZ education portal to allow the users to test and improve their knowledge and skills in the field of acute medicine. In the feedback survey, 62 participants completed the online questionnaire (13.5\%) from the total 460 addressed. Positive attitudes toward the interactive algorithms outnumbered negative trends.
Conclusions: The peer-reviewed algorithms were used for conducting problem-based learning sessions in general medicine (first aid, anesthesiology and pain management, emergency medicine) and in nursing (emergency medicine for midwives, obstetric analgesia, and anesthesia for midwifes). The feedback from the survey suggests that the students found the interactive algorithms as effective learning tools, facilitating enhanced knowledge in the field of acute medicine. The interactive algorithms, as a software platform, are open to academic use worldwide. The existing algorithms, in the form of simulation-based learning objects, can be incorporated into any educational website (subject to the approval of the authors).},

Second-generation curriculum managing systems foster knowledge management processes including curriculum mapping in order to give comprehensive support to learners, teachers, and administrators. The large quantity of custom-built software in this field indicates a shortcoming of available IT tools and standards.
Objective: The project reported here aims at the systematic adoption of techniques and standards of the Social Semantic Web to implement collaborative curriculum mapping for a complete medical model curriculum.
Methods: A semantic MediaWiki (SMW)-based Web application has been introduced as a platform for the elicitation and revision process of the Aachen Catalogue of Learning Objectives (ACLO). The semantic wiki uses a domain model of the curricular context and offers structured (form-based) data entry, multiple views, structured querying, semantic indexing, and commenting for learning objectives (“LOs”). Semantic indexing of learning objectives relies on both a controlled vocabulary of international medical classifications (ICD, MeSH) and a folksonomy maintained by the users. An additional module supporting the global checking of consistency complements the semantic wiki. Statements of the Object Constraint Language define the consistency criteria. We evaluated the application by a scenario-based formative usability study, where the participants solved tasks in the (fictional) context of 7 typical situations and answered a questionnaire containing Likert-scaled items and free-text questions.
Results: At present, ACLO contains roughly 5350 operational (ie, specific and measurable) objectives acquired during the last 25 months. The wiki-based user interface uses 13 online forms for data entry and 4 online forms for flexible searches of LOs, and all the forms are accessible by standard Web browsers. The formative usability study yielded positive results (median rating of 2 (“good”) in all 7 general usability items) and produced valuable qualitative feedback, especially concerning navigation and comprehensibility. Although not asked to, the participants (n=5) detected critical aspects of the curriculum (similar learning objectives addressed repeatedly and missing objectives), thus proving the system’s ability to support curriculum revision.
Conclusions: The SMW-based approach enabled an agile implementation of computer-supported knowledge management. The approach, based on standard Social Semantic Web formats and technology, represents a feasible and effectively applicable compromise between answering to the individual requirements of curriculum management at a particular medical school and using proprietary systems.},

	abstract = {Background: During their studies, pharmacy students must acquire the specific skills in clinical virology required for their subsequent professional practice. Recent experiments on teaching and learning in higher education have shown that hybrid courses strengthen the students’ commitment to learning and enable high-quality knowledge acquisition.
Objective: This study concerned the design and deployment of a hybrid course that combines face-to-face and Web-based instruction in clinical virology for fourth-year pharmacy students. The study’s objectives were to (1) measure the students’ level of involvement in the course, (2) gauge their interest in this type of learning, and (3) highlight any associated difficulties.
Methods: The study included 194 fourth-year pharmacy students from the Lille Faculty of Pharmacy (University of Lille, Lille, France) between January and June 2017. The students followed a hybrid course comprising an online learning module and 5 tutorial sessions in which professional situations were simulated. The learning module and 3 online evaluation sessions were delivered via the Moodle learning management system. Each tutorial session ended with an evaluation. The number of Moodle log-ins, the number of views of learning resources, and the evaluation marks were recorded. The coefficient for the correlation between the marks in the online evaluation and those in the tutorials was calculated. The students’ opinions and level of satisfaction were evaluated via a course questionnaire.
Results: The course’s learning resources and Web pages were viewed 21,446 and 3413 times, respectively. Of the 194 students, 188 (96.9\%) passed the course (ie, marks of at least 10 out of 20). There was a satisfactory correlation between the marks obtained in the online evaluations and those obtained after the tutorials. The course met the students’ expectations in 53.2\% of cases, and 57.4\% of the students stated that they were able to work at their own pace. Finally, 26.6\% of the students stated that they had difficulty organizing their work around this hybrid course.
Conclusions: Our results showed that pharmacy students were strongly in favor of a hybrid course. The levels of attendance and participation were high. However, teachers must be aware that some students will encounter organizational difficulties.},

	abstract = {Background: Chatbots are applications that can conduct natural language conversations with users. In the medical field, chatbots have been developed and used to serve different purposes. They provide patients with timely information that can be critical in some scenarios, such as access to mental health resources. Since the development of the first chatbot, ELIZA, in the late 1960s, much effort has followed to produce chatbots for various health purposes developed in different ways.
Objective: This study aimed to explore the technical aspects and development methodologies associated with chatbots used in the medical field to explain the best methods of development and support chatbot development researchers on their future work.
Methods: We searched for relevant articles in 8 literature databases (IEEE, ACM, Springer, ScienceDirect, Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar). We also performed forward and backward reference checking of the selected articles. Study selection was performed by one reviewer, and 50\% of the selected studies were randomly checked by a second reviewer. A narrative approach was used for result synthesis. Chatbots were classified based on the different technical aspects of their development. The main chatbot components were identified in addition to the different techniques for implementing each module.
Results: The original search returned 2481 publications, of which we identified 45 studies that matched our inclusion and exclusion criteria. The most common language of communication between users and chatbots was English (n=23). We identified 4 main modules: text understanding module, dialog management module, database layer, and text generation module. The most common technique for developing text understanding and dialogue management is the pattern matching method (n=18 and n=25, respectively). The most common text generation is fixed output (n=36). Very few studies relied on generating original output. Most studies kept a medical knowledge base to be used by the chatbot for different purposes throughout the conversations. A few studies kept conversation scripts and collected user data and previous conversations.
Conclusions: Many chatbots have been developed for medical use, at an increasing rate. There is a recent, apparent shift in adopting machine learning–based approaches for developing chatbot systems. Further research can be conducted to link clinical outcomes to different chatbot development techniques and technical characteristics.},

	abstract = {The paper examines the state of the problem of the influence of risks on the project team's work process. The processes of the team's work during the implementation of the project sprint are defined. The authors identified risk factors that affect the effectiveness of the project team. An analysis of modern approaches was carried out and three directions were identified, which represent the research of project team management processes under conditions of risk. A comprehensive reference model of project team management under risk conditions is proposed in the form of a framework. It reflects the interrelationship of four models: the project team behavior model, the model for assessing the quality of the formation of sprint tasks, the model for determining the distribution of tasks in the project team, and the model for the formation of recommendations. The project team evaluates the text description of the task, obtained from the information system, using the sprint task formation quality assessment model. Natural language processing methods are used to create a model for evaluating the quality of forming sprint tasks, which combine the method of processing text information and the method of learning based on precedents, which allows taking into account the previous experience of the team and its behavior. The project team behavior model allows taking into account the risks of irrational work organization during the sprint. The behavior of the project team is analyzed using Process Mining methods. The case representation model allows the project team to store and reuse knowledge and experience based on simulation modeling and reinforcement learning approaches. It allows the team to determine and evaluate possible options for the distribution of tasks and resources in the team in accordance with the reduction of possible risks. The central element of the proposed framework is the model of recommendations used in decision-making. It provides the project team with the necessary information for effective decision-making in terms of risks in project management. The proposed framework provides an opportunity to reduce the impact of the risks of non-fulfillment of project tasks during the sprint. Further studies of the task of managing the project team under conditions of risk should be directed to the development of specified models of the proposed framework.},

	abstract = {Background: Serious games involving virtual patients in medical education can provide a controlled setting within which players can learn in an engaging way, while avoiding the risks associated with real patients. Moreover, serious games align with medical students’ preferred learning styles. The Virtual Emergency TeleMedicine (VETM) game is a simulation-based game that was developed in collaboration with the mEducator Best Practice network in response to calls to integrate serious games in medical education and training. The VETM game makes use of data from an electrocardiogram to train practicing doctors, nurses, or medical students for problem-solving in real-life clinical scenarios through a telemedicine system and virtual patients. The study responds to two gaps: the limited number of games in emergency cardiology and the lack of evaluations by professionals. Objective: The objective of this study is a quantitative, professional feedback-informed evaluation of one scenario of VETM, involving cardiovascular complications. The study has the following research question: “What are professionals’ perceptions of the potential of the Virtual Emergency Telemedicine game for training people involved in the assessment and management of emergency cases?” Methods: The evaluation of the VETM game was conducted with 90 professional ambulance crew nursing personnel specializing in the assessment and management of emergency cases. After collaboratively trying out one VETM scenario, participants individually completed an evaluation of the game (36 questions on a 5-point Likert scale) and provided written and verbal comments. The instrument assessed six dimensions of the game: (1) user interface, (2) difficulty level, (3) feedback, (4) educational value, (5) user engagement, and (6) terminology. Data sources of the study were 90 questionnaires, including written comments from 51 participants, 24 interviews with 55 participants, and 379 log files of their interaction with the game.},

	abstract = {Background: This study aims to identify a novel potential use for web portals in health care and health research: their adoption for the purposes of rapidly sharing health research findings with clinicians, scientists, and patients. In the era of precision medicine and learning health systems, the translation of research findings into targeted therapies depends on the availability of big data and emerging research results. Web portals may work to promote the availability of novel research, working in tandem with traditional scientific publications and conference proceedings. Objective: This study aims to assess the potential use of web portals, which facilitate the sharing of health research findings among researchers, clinicians, patients, and the public. It also summarizes the potential legal, ethical, and policy implications associated with such tools for public use and in the management of patient care for complex diseases. Methods: This study broadly adopts the methods for scoping literature reviews outlined by Arskey and O?Malley in 2005. Raised by the integration of web portals into patient care for complex diseases, we systematically searched 3 databases, PubMed, Scopus, and WestLaw Next, for sources describing web portals for sharing health research findings among clinicians, researchers, and patients and their associated legal, ethical, and policy challenges. Of the 719 candidate source citations, 22 were retained for the review. Results: We found varied and inconsistent treatment of web portals for sharing health research findings among clinicians, researchers, and patients. Although the literature supports the view that portals of this kind are potentially highly promising, they remain novel and are not yet widely adopted. We also found a wide range of discussions on the legal, ethical, and policy issues related to the use of web portals to share research data. Conclusions: We identified 5 important legal and ethical challenges: privacy and confidentiality, patient health literacy, equity, training, and decision-making. We contend that each of these has meaningful implications for the increased integration of web portals into clinical care.},

	abstract = {Background: Using serious games for learning in operations management is well established. However, especially for logistics skills in health care operations, there is little work on the design of game mechanics for learning engagement and the achievement of the desired learning goals. Objective: This contribution presents a serious game design representing patient flow characteristics, systemic resource configurations, and the roles of the players based on a real Swedish emergency ward. The game was tested in a set of game-based learning practices in the modalities of a physical board game and an online multiplayer serious game that implemented the same game structure. Methods: First, survey scores were collected using the Game Experience Questionnaire Core and Social Presence Modules to evaluate the experience and acceptance of the proposed design to gamify real processes in emergency care. Second, lag sequential analysis was applied to analyze the impact of the game mechanics on learning behavior transitions. Lastly, regression analysis was used to understand whether learning engagement attributes could potentially serve as significant predicting variables for logistical performance in a simulated learning environment. Results: A total of 36 students from courses in engineering and management at KTH Royal Institute of Technology participated in both game-based learning practices during the autumn and spring semesters of 2019 and 2020. For the Core Module, significant differences were found for the scores for negative affect and tension compared with the rest of the module. For the Social Presence Module, significant differences were found in the scores for the psychological involvement ? negative feelings dimension compared with the rest of the module. During the process of content generation, the participant had access to circulating management resources and could edit profiles. The standard regression analysis output yielded a ?R2 of 0.796 (F14,31=2725.49, P{\textless}.001) for the board version and 0.702 (F24,31=2635.31, P{\textless}.001) for the multiplayer online version after the learning engagement attributes. Conclusions: The high scores of positive affect and immersion compared to the low scores of negative feelings demonstrated the motivating and cognitive involvement impact of the game. The proposed game mechanics have visible effects on significant correlation parameters between the majority of scoring features and changes in learning engagement attributes. Therefore, we conclude that for enhancing learning in logistical aspects of health care, serious games that are steered by well-designed scoring mechanisms can be used.},

The aim of this research is to present results of a retrospective, qualitative content analysis of student related perceptions about group work in the online classroom.
Methods: Data analysis was completed with the use of qualitative content analysis (QCA), a valid research method for describing the meaning of qualitative data in a systematic way. QCA was used to inform the following research question: What perceptions do students have about working with a group in the online classroom? Data were collected through a retrospective analysis of student responses posted to discussion board forums. Responses of students (N = 192) enrolled in three different courses, over two semesters were analyzed by a team of two researchers.
Results: Findings included student reflections about group work being a stressful, negative experience, with the asynchronous environment of the online classroom increasing student anxiety about group work. Students reported different academic goals and lack of participation among group members as common issues. In addition, students reported concern with group management or organization and the fairness of group work grading practices.
Conclusions: These results inform a discussion of best practices, skills and technology faculty can use to transform online group work into a positive learning experience for all students. Online education needs to be meaningful and responsive to meet students’ needs. Research has shown group work can improve student engagement and facilitate accomplishment; however, the negotiation of group work processes can be stressful for students and faculty, particularly in the online classroom.},

This paper presents a systematic review of representative literature dealing with online participation in education. All subscribed resources in Web of Science were systematically searched with no time frame limit, and a total of 30 relevant studies published between 1996 and 2020 were selected. Proposed classification of a variety of approaches that evidently enhance and encourage online participation is based on actual empirical results and evidences reported in each analysed study. The key research findings revealed that different communication support (like discussion forums, blogs, and chats) and teaching strategies (like flipped learning, personalized communication, and gamification) were evidenced as predominantly employed approaches which proved to enhance online participation. Besides, facilitative strategies and tools (like online peer voting, wikis, and blogs) along with other support mechanisms (like social media and group awareness tools) were also regarded as valuable means of participation encouragement. Furthermore, in a great majority of analysed research, university students were found to be involved participants (in terms of data collection), while half of studies relied on Learning Management System as supporting technology. The conducted review exposed also a significant empirical evidence to support the argument that students’ learning performance could be enhanced by improving online participation. Further research directions and potential challenges are offered as well.},

	abstract = {The global health crisis caused by COVID-19 has forced the migration of classes to online education with the help of learning management system. As students are the key stakeholders who will determine the adoption or usage of it, their perceptions of it need to be considered. In this regard, this study aims to evaluate students' satisfaction toward BrightSpace, an adopted LMS by Indiana Aerospace University, using Nguyen's (2021) LMS satisfaction model, with sex and year levels added as moderating variables. Using a quantitative cross-sectional survey design, 602 students from different degree programs participated in an online survey deployed using Google Forms. The survey aimed to test the inﬂuence of system content, instruction information, interaction, and technology quality on students' perceived LMS usefulness, and the inﬂuence of perceived usefulness on students' LMS satisfaction. The ﬁndings of structural equation modeling suggest that system content, interaction, and technology quality signiﬁcantly and positively inﬂuenced students' perceived usefulness, subsequently leading to their satisfaction with the LMS. Results further revealed that sex is a moderating variable that inﬂuences the relationships between system content and instruction information with students' perceived usefulness of the LMS. Also, year level is a moderating variable of the relationships between system content and interaction with their perceived usefulness of the LMS. In conclusion, this study reveals the model's usefulness in understanding the factors inﬂuencing students' satisfaction with an LMS. Consequently, the results offer practical implications for practitioners in designing and increasing LMS satisfaction to create a more effective learning environment.},

	abstract = {This design-based research (DBR) study was conducted to identify the type of learning activities and assessments that are responsible for fostering transdisciplinary skills (t-skills) in higher ed­ ucation online courses. T-skills are transferable skills that apply across the disciplines and that have been identified as needed for life and career success in the 21st century. The study addressed two major research questions: (1) “To what extent does the intervention - a new outcomes table aid in tracking transdisciplinary skills in the design of online courses?” and (2) “What design principles guide the development of learning activities and assessments that foster t-skills?” To address the first question, the researchers developed a design intervention, an outcomes mapping protocol, that was used to map t-skills in 75 unique online courses and deployed the learning outcomes feature of the learning management system to generate learning outcomes analytics on t-skills. The new mapping process captured not only the intended disciplinary goals (what was taught) but also the competencies fostered by the learning design (how the curriculum was taught). To address the second question, the researchers asked learners in these 75 courses to select the top skill resulting from the online course they had just completed and to reflect in writing how the learning activities or assessments in that online course had helped them foster the t-skill they selected. We then coded the learners’ feedback into design principles. The theoretical outcomes of this DBR study constitute refined active learning design principles that tie the development of t-skills to active learning methods. The practical outcome of this DBR provides a new instructional design process for instructors, designers, and administrators to effectively map t-skills across any semester-based curriculum.},

	abstract = {In higher education, providing personalized feedback and support to students is a significant challenge. Early warning systems can help by identifying both at-risk and high-performing students, allowing for timely in­ terventions and enhanced learning opportunities. In our study, we used a year’s worth of data from an infor­ mation management school to build predictive models for two binary classification problems: identifying at-risk students and high-performing students. We employed traditional machine learning classifiers and long-short term memory units (LSTM), testing them at various stages of course completion. The best performance was achieved using all course data, with an AUC of 0.756 for at-risk students and 78.2\% accuracy for high-performing students using Random Forest and Extremely Randomized Trees, respectively. We found that early prediction was possible as early as 25\% course completion. Although LSTM showed inferior performance, it offered prac­ tical advantages for early prediction. Our findings suggest that static LMS logs can be reliable indicators of student success early in a course, and a course-agnostic time-dependent representation of the number of clicks can offer a worthwhile tradeoff between predictive performance and simplicity in implementation in some in­ stances. These findings have important implications as they suggest the potential for automated early warning systems that can help educators identify students of interest and allocate resources where they are most needed. However, implementing these systems in real-time requires clear protocols and responsible policies. Further research should explore the generalizability of findings across different contexts and continuously evaluate their real-world effectiveness.},

	abstract = {Research has repeatedly demonstrated that students with effective learning strategies are more likely to have better academic achievement. Existing research has mostly focused on a single course or two, while longitudinal studies remain scarce. The present study examines the longitudinal sequence of students’ strategies, their suc­ cession, consistency, temporal unfolding, and whether students tend to retain or adapt strategies between courses. We use a large dataset of online traces from 135 students who completed 10 successive courses (i.e., 1350 course enrollments) in a higher education program. The methods used in this study have shown the feasibility of using trace data recorded by learning management systems to unobtrusively trace and model the longitudinal learning strategies across a program. We identified three program-level strategy trajectories: a stable and intense trajectory related to deep learning where students used diverse strategies and scored the highest grades; a fluctuating interactive trajectory, where students focused on course requirements, scored average grades, and were relatively fluctuating; and a light trajectory related to surface learning where students invested the least effort, scored the lowest grades, and had a relatively stable pathway. Students who were intensely active were more likely to transfer the intense strategies and therefore, they were expected to require less support or guidance. Students focusing on course requirements were not as effective self-regulators as they seemed and possibly required early guidance and support from teachers. Students with consistent light strategies or low effort needed proactive guidance and support.},

	abstract = {Background: The Strengthening and Stretching for Rheumatoid Arthritis of the Hand (SARAH) is a tailored, progressive exercise program for people having difficulties with wrist and hand function due to rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The program was evaluated in a large-scale clinical trial and was found to improve hand function, was safe to deliver, and was cost-effective. These findings led to the SARAH program being recommended in the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines for the management of adults with RA. To facilitate the uptake of this evidence-based program by clinicians, we proposed a Web-based training program for SARAH (iSARAH) to educate and train physiotherapists and occupational therapists on delivering the SARAH program in their practice. The overall iSARAH implementation project was guided by the 5 phases of the analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation (ADDIE) system design model. Objective: The objective of our study was to conduct the first 3 phases of the model in the development of the iSARAH project. Methods: Following publication of the trial, the SARAH program materials were made available to therapists to download from the trial website for use in clinical practice. A total of 35 therapists who downloaded these materials completed an online survey to provide feedback on practice trends in prescribing hand exercises for people with RA, perceived barriers and facilitators to using the SARAH program in clinical practice, and their preferences for the content and Web features of iSARAH. The development and design of iSARAH were further guided by a team of multidisciplinary health professionals (n=17) who took part in a half-day development meeting. We developed the preliminary version of iSARAH and tested it among therapists (n=10) to identify and rectify usability issues and to produce the final version. Results: The major recommendations made by therapists and the multidisciplinary team were having a simple Web design and layout, clear exercise pictures and videos, and compatibility of iSARAH on various browsers and devices. We rectified all usability issues in the preliminary version to develop the final version of iSARAH, which included 4 short modules and additional sections on self-assessment, frequently asked questions, and a resource library. Conclusions: The use of the ADDIE design model and engagement of end users in the development and evaluation phases have rendered iSARAH a convenient, easy-to-use, and effective Web-based learning resource for therapists on how to deliver the SARAH program. There is also huge potential for adapting iSARAH across different cultures and languages, thus opening more opportunities for wider uptake and application of the SARAH program into practice.},

	abstract = {Background: Technological innovations such as Learning Management Systems (LMS) are becoming more and more prevalent in the learning environments of students. Distilling and acting on knowledge gathered from these systems, the field known as learning analytics, allows educators to hone their craft and support students more effectively by providing timely interventions.
Objectives: While most learning analytics studies focus on using LMS data to predict performance, this study instead predicts students' self-reported time-management skills using trace data from the Canvas LMS. This is done for courses at one Dutch technical university with in total 462 students.
Methods: Linear regression and multi-level regression models are constructed using both theory and findings from previous research. The predictions made by these models are compared to previously filled in questionnaire data to validate the results.
Results: Our results show that models can be constructed and time-management can be predicted for individual courses. Furthermore, there are several predictors that are significant in multiple models. However, these models and predictions are not immediately transferable to other courses.
Conclusions: The study therefore emphasizes the need for further research, using multiple sources of data or more theoretically grounded predictors, to investigate the extent of the portability issues with these predictive models. Despite this we were able to predict the students' self-reported time-management skills in multiple different courses using Learning Analytics, and managed to identify multiple consistently predictive trace data variables.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Wiki systems are becoming increasingly important in university teaching. Not much is known about the opinion of lecturers of veterinary medicine regarding the active participation of students in teaching, their opinion on wiki systems and their motivation to use them in courses and to improve the quality of information. The objective of the present study was to evaluate how lecturers of veterinary medicine estimate learning management systems and the production of text or material by students in courses, if they rate wiki systems as an appropriate tool for teaching, if they would use wiki systems for their courses and if they are willing to improve the quality of information.
Methods: The data collection was carried out as an online survey using a five-point Likert scale. Lecturers of veterinary medicine in Germany, Austria and Switzerland were contacted (n=approx. 1700) out of which 139 completed (8.2\%) the survey.
Results: Most lecturers use LMS and consider it to be suitable for providing course material. Half of all respondents indicated that they believe that students achieve greater learning success by developing their own learning material. In courses 23.0\% of their students develop own materials. The majority of lecturers considered wiki systems as an appropriate and complementary tool for teaching (53.6\%). A collection of wiki articles is seen as useful (56.6\%), particularly when experts review the contents. One third of the lecturers would use wiki systems for the creation of material by students, but 82.5\% have not yet used them in teaching. One third is willing to participate in the review of articles with regard to their quality.
Conclusion: The results show that many lecturers are willing to use veterinary wiki systems and that they regard them useful for teaching. According to the opinion of the majority of lecturers, the creation of material by students can lead to greater learning success and wiki systems are suitable for this purpose. We are about to develop strategies to support the implementation of wiki systems into veterinary education and a peer review system supported by lecturers. In a further project the actual learning success provided by the active use of wiki-systems by students will be evaluated.},

The analysis of 58 selected articles provides an overview of current literature with the identification of four themes such as 1) the design of the innovative learning spaces, 2) pedagogies employed in the innovative learning spaces, 3) students’ experiences in the innovative learning spaces, and 4) change management approaches towards the campus innovative learning space. The types of learning spaces influenced by the trends in pedagogy (towards constructivist approaches, such as active learning spaces) and technology (towards less physicality, such as hybrid learning spaces) are explored in this study. The analysis finalizes the challenges and recommendations for innovative learning space integration into campus teaching and learning experiences. It sets a foundation for further thematic analysis of innovative learning spaces literature.},

Dieser Kontext stellt sich nicht bloß als passiver Akteur dar, der sich bedingungslos den Anforderungen der KI unterwirft. Stattdessen prägen Data Scientists, Bürger*innen, Wirtschaftsunternehmen, Bildungseinrichtungen, staatliche Institutionen sowie NGOs durch ihre spezifischen Rollen und Kompetenzen die Modalitäten, wie und in welchem Maße KI realisiert und angewendet wird. Die Evolution künstlicher Intelligenz findet dabei nicht außerhalb eines rechtlichen Rahmens statt. Gesetzliche, ökonomische und soziale Konstrukte definieren einen normativen gesellschaftlichen Rahmen, innerhalb dessen KI operiert.

	abstract = {Lernen in der beruflichen Aus- und Weiterbildung hat verschiedene Bedingungen (z. B. die Motivation) und Anforderungen (z. B. Connectivity of Education and Work), was auch in der Gestaltung von digitalen Lernumgebungen in der beruflichen Bildung berücksichtigt werden muss. Die hier beschriebene Studie fokussiert folgende Forschungsfrage: Inwiefern gibt es Zusammen­ hänge zwischen motivationalen Lernbedingungen, Self-Directed Learning als Lernaktivität und Theorie-Praxis-Transfer von Ler­ nenden in digitalen Lernumgebungen in der Pflegeausbildung? Theoretische Basis stellen die Modelle des Instructional Design dar, hier insbesondere das Vier-Komponenten-Modell. In einer querschnittlichen Online-Fragebogenstudie wurden daher 330 Auszubildende in der Pflege unter anderem zu ihrem selbstgesteuerten Lernen (Aeppli, 2005), der ihnen zur Verfügung stehen­ den digitalen Ausstattung (Freie Universität Berlin, 2008), zu deren Selbstwirksamkeit (Fisher \& King, 2009, S. 44-48), ihren motivationalen Aspekten (Müller et al., 2007) und dem Theorie-Praxis-Transfer (Anselmann, 2022) befragt. Mithilfe von de­ skriptiven statistischen Analysen wie auch Regressionsanalysen wurden die Daten ausgewertet. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass das selbstgesteuerte Lernen umso besser gelingt, je besser die Betreuung der Auszubildenden im Rahmen der digitalen Lehre durch ihre Lehrkräfte ist. Der Theorie-Praxis-Transfer gelingt umso besser, je besser die Lernenden selbstgesteuert lernen. Der Fokus der Lehrenden sollte demnach in der digitalen Lehre auf die Betreuung der Lernenden gelegt werden. Die Lernenden benötigen nicht viele unterschiedliche Tools.},

In nursing training, the potential of the use of digital media has not yet been fully exploited. Digital media, such as learning platforms (Moodle), programs (PowerPoint) or individual tools (flinga), are integrated in teaching processes. Nevertheless, the use is rarely carried out in a nursingdidactically way (Darmann-Finck 2010). Media didactic approaches to shape digitally supported learning (Kerres 2018; Jahnke 2015), do not adequately address the requirements of contents in nursing training. In the CARO project (running 2016 to 2019), a so-called Classroom Learning Interaction System (CARO CLIS) was developed and evaluated to support live interactions in the classroom. The CARO CLIS supports complex learning, interaction and reflection processes in a nursing and media-didactic way. The following article shows the development and evaluation of the software as well as the teaching content based on the design-based research approach (DBR) (Koppel 2016). In addition, it is exemplified how the CARO CLIS supports nursing-didactically well-founded complex educational goals using media-didactic interaction formats.},

              Hintergrund
              Die COVID-19 Pandemie stellt die medizinischen Fakultäten vor beispiellose Herausforderungen. Kontaktbeschränkung als wirksamstes Mittel der Infektionsprävention macht den traditionellen Präsenzunterricht nahezu unmöglich. Daher sind neue Lehrmethoden erforderlich, um das Infektionsrisiko einzudämmen und gleichzeitig hochwertigen Unterricht zu gewährleisten.
            
            
              Fragestellung
              Um den Bedarf an Präsenzunterricht zu reduzieren, wurde unter Anwendung von Open-Source-Software im Rahmen eines Pilotprojekts eine multimediale, virtuelle Lernumgebung für das Fach „Anästhesiologie und Notfallmedizin“ entwickelt und deren Akzeptanz bei Studierenden untersucht. Gleichzeitig beantworten wir die Frage, ob diese Technologie eine taugliche Alternative zum klassischen Präsenzunterricht darstellt.
            
            
              Material und Methoden
              Wir haben mit dem Lernmanagementsystem „Moodle“ eine multimediale eLearning-Plattform entsprechend dem Lehrplan „Anästhesiologie und Notfallmedizin“ für das 2. klinische Studienjahr geschaffen. Es wurde eine anonymisierte Nachkursbefragung mit Multiple-Choice- und Freitextfragen durchgeführt.
            
            
              Ergebnisse
              85,4 \% der 157 Teilnehmer bewerteten den Kurs als „sehr gut“, 12,1 \% als „gut“ und 1,9 \% als „o.k.“. Niedrigere Bewertungen wurden nicht gegeben. 54,8 \% bewerteten den Kursinhalt als „sehr relevant“, 43,3 \% als „relevant“ und 1,9 \% als „neutral“. 94,3 \% waren der Ansicht, dass „mehr vergleichbare Online-Kurse angeboten werden sollten“. Die Freitextantworten zeigten, dass Barrierefreiheit und multimediales, selbstgesteuertes Lernen sehr geschätzt wurden. Es wurde jedoch auch angemerkt, dass die praktische Ausbildung nicht durch eLearning ersetzt werden kann.
            
            
              Diskussion
              „Technology enhanced learning“ wurde von unseren Studierenden sehr gut angenommen und als gute Alternative zum Präsenzunterricht bewertet. Für das Erlernen praktischer Fertigkeiten bleibt der Präsenzunterricht jedoch unverzichtbar.

            Abstract
            
              Background
              Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has brought about unprecedented challenges to medical schools. Physical distancing as the most effective means of infection prevention renders traditional classroom teaching nearly impossible and new teaching methods are required to contain the infection risk whilst ensuring high-level education.
            
            
              Objective
              In order to minimize the need for classroom teaching we have created an interactive multimedia eLearning environment using the open-source learning management system “Moodle”. This article describes the development of the eLearning environment and aims to establish the acceptance of technology-enhanced learning (TEL) among medical students and the evaluation of TEL as an alternative to classroom teaching.
            
            
              Material and methods
              We have built a multimedia eLearning environment for fourth year medical students covering the medical school curriculum “anesthesiology and emergency medicine”, which is based on the recommendations of the German Society for Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine (DGAI). We have chosen the open-source learning management system “Moodle” as a platform. “Moodle” is widely used by Anglo-American educational institutions to support and conduct academic and nonacademic teaching. In order to assess the students’ experience, we have carried out an anonymized post-course survey consisting of multiple-choice and free-answer questions.
            
            
              Results
              Of the 157 participants 85.4\% rated the course as “very good”, 12.1\% as “good” and 1.9\% as “OK”. Lower ratings were not given, 54.8\% rated the course content as “very relevant”, 43.3\% as “relevant” and 1.9\% as “neutral”, 94.3\% felt that more comparable online courses should be offered. The free-text answers revealed that accessibility and multimedia self-controlled learning were highly valued; however, it was felt that hands-on training cannot be replaced by eLearning.
            
            
              Conclusion
              Technology Enhanced Learning was highly valued by our students and helped to reduce the need for classroom teaching; however, for teaching practical skills classroom teaching remains indispensable.},

              Despite the significance of self-regulated learning as an important educational goal, teachers face difficulties in fostering students’ skills in self-regulated learning (SRL). Teachers exhibit variability in their capacity to foster SRL. There is no guarantee that students consistently benefit from their teachers’ promotion of SRL. This study aims to address this issue by examining (1) how teachers promote SRL, (2) the relationship between teachers’ professional competences and their promotion of SRL, and (3) the association between teachers’ promotion of SRL and students’ SRL. Data from
              N
               = 54 teachers and their
              N
               = 823 lower secondary school students were analysed using online questionnaires, knowledge tests, and video recordings. The analysed video data reveals that teachers foster SRL predominantly implicitly, invest most of the time in promoting metacognitive strategies and primarily design learning environments that foster student support. Overall, only a few significant correlations were found between teachers’ professional competences and their promotion of SRL. Further, the results indicate no clear correlation pattern between teachers’ promotion and students’ skills in SRL. Further research should shed more light on the relationship between teachers’ promotion of SRL and students’ SRL to better understand whether and how they might be related.

            Zusammenfassung
            
              Trotz der Bedeutung des selbstregulierten Lernens (SRL) als wichtiges Bildungsziel, haben Lehrkräfte Schwierigkeiten, die Fähigkeiten der Schüler:innen zum SRL zu fördern. Lehrkräfte zeigen unterschiedliche Fähigkeiten, selbstreguliertes Lernen zu fördern. Es ist nicht garantiert, dass Schüler:innen von der Förderung des selbstregulierten Lernens durch ihre Lehrkräfte profitieren. Daher untersucht diese Studie (1) wie Lehrkräfte SRL fördern, (2) die Beziehung zwischen den professionellen Kompetenzen der Lehrkräfte und ihrer Förderung des SRL und (3) den Zusammenhang zwischen der Förderung des SRL durch die Lehrkräfte und dem SRL der Schüler:innen. Die Daten von

              N
               = 823 Schüler:innen der Sekundarstufe I wurden anhand von Online-Fragebögen, Wissenstests und Videoaufnahmen analysiert. Die analysierten Videodaten zeigen, dass die Lehrkräfte das SRL überwiegend implizit fördern, die meiste Zeit in die Förderung metakognitiver Strategien investieren und primär Lernumgebungen gestalten, die die Schüler:innen unterstützen. Insgesamt wurden nur wenige signifikante Korrelationen zwischen den professionellen Kompetenzen der Lehrkräfte und ihrer Förderung des SRL gefunden. Darüber hinaus zeigen die Ergebnisse kein klares Korrelationsmuster zwischen der Förderung der Lehrkräfte und dem SRL der Schüler:innen. Weitere Untersuchungen sollten die Beziehung zwischen der Förderung des SRL durch die Lehrkräfte und dem SRL der Schüler:innen genauer beleuchten, um besser zu verstehen ob und wie diese zusammenhängen könnten.},

	abstract = {The use of virtual reality and 360° videos has been little researched so far, especially in social work studies and teaching. The reasons for this are the low prevalence of VR headsets in social work courses and the fundamental technological deficit in social work, which means the lack of clear causal chains within it. Professionals must adapt their practical knowledge to the individual framework conditions and problem situations depending on the case situation and field of work. In contrast, in simulation-based approaches, as used in the teaching of many rather object-oriented courses of study, fixed sequences of action usually lead to success. At the same time, 360° videos, with suitable didactic framing, can be used to convey case studies in an immersive manner that can then be continued individually, methodically developed and reflected upon. In the” Teilprojekt XR”, two approaches to the use of VR headsets were designed, the first enables remote collaboration, the second offers a chance for analysis and reflection using 360° videos. The first approach is Collaborative work using VR headsets, which is intended to be an addition to communication with existing video conferencing systems. It has the potential to counteract the previous challenges associated with zoom technology and create more proximity. The first few evaluation results (n=11) on the methodological implementation of collaborative work with VR headsets suggest that this approach can bring added value to students. However, getting started with VR headsets is challenging for students and only a few have taken up the offer so far. The integration of 360° videos in education has potential for social work, as the high degree of realism and immersion can improve the link between theory and practice. Students can thus obtain realistic insights into practical examples already during their studies and professionally reflect on their own perspective in the situations. The use of 360° videos using VR headsets has been tested and established in teaching in four seminars so far. The students experience the simulated case situations from the subjective perspective of the different protagonists and can thus more easily put themselves in their individual perspective. Didactically, these observations are professionally framed by teaching content taught in advance, group work in small numbers as well as a collaborative analysis and reflection within the seminar group. The results of the evaluation (n=60) of the integration of 360° videos into teaching are promising and show a clear potential for university didactics. A flow experience and an experience of presence were confirmed by the students when working with the 360° videos. Furthermore, the students reported that the methodological extension supported their comprehension of the course materials and validate the usefulness and advantages of using 360° videos during the seminars.},

This research presents a novel AI-Powered Learning System integrating conversational agents and collaborative scaffolding tools toward personalized and socially constructed learning. Grounded in pedagogical theories situating the zone of proximal development, the system employs natural language processing to provide adaptive explanations responsive to individual needs. Students likewise self-organize into peer groups with supports for co-generative dialogue, resource sharing, and collaborative evaluation. Initial system trials reveal positive outcomes surpassing baseline e-learning platforms on dimensions of efficiency, comprehension, motivation, and critical thinking. Planned future enhancements will enrich adaptivity and accessibility through multimodal interactions, reinforcement learning algorithms, and localized adaptations. However, ethical priorities remain paramount regarding privacy, inclusion, and human agency as complements, not replacements, for skilled educators. By reconciling AI innovations with the centrality of social relations, this research contributes conceptual and technological foundations for nextgeneration learning systems that realize the full spectrum of human potential.},

The aim of this study is to compare the standard BLS teaching methodology (control) vs blended learning with a shortened face to face course (intervention), and determine if we can get high quality CPR performance.
Methods: An experimental study was designed where lay students and staff of a university school were allocated to the control or the intervention group. Randomization was done by the own participants choosing the day of the course. Participants in the control group had the BLS manual one week prior of the course, meanwhile participants in the intervention group had to complete some tasks with the help of the BLS manual and see some videos explaining the two ﬁrst steps of the ERC teaching methodology, during the previous week. Laerdal QCPR mannequins and software was used. Mean and standard deviation or percents were used to describe data and Chi square test or Student’s T test or Mann–Whitney’s U test to compare data.
Results: 56 out of 119 candidates were allocated in the intervention group. No signiﬁcant differences between age, sex were observed between groups. QCPR global score was 70.5\% (SD: 23.0\%) in the control group vs 68.4\% (SD: 21.4\%) in the intervention group (p = 0.618). Mean chest compression depth was 50.34 vs 50.21 (p = 0.935), mean compressions rate 105.52 vs 107.90 (p = 0.401). Mean breathing volume 759 ml vs 642 ml (p =v0.054)
Conclusions: No difference was found in high quality CPR between both teaching methods. New studies with more sample size would be recommended to conﬁrm these results.},

	abstract = {Background: While e-learning has been written about extensively within the context of orthopaedics in the United States, there are few articles describing e-learning initiatives geared towards low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). The Institute for Global Orthopaedics and Traumatology (IGOT) at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) developed the IGOT Learning Portal to meet this need.
Methods: The IGOT Learning Portal was designed to address knowledge gaps in patient care by increasing access to high-quality orthopaedic education for surgeons and trainees worldwide. It offers 10 distinct, asynchronous courses, which are divided into a modular format. Course enrollment is free and accessible to any surgeon or trainee with a web-browsing capable device and internet connection.
Results: There are more than 2700 registered users and 300 active learners enrolled in IGOT Learning Portal courses. The Surgical Management and Reconstructive Training (SMART) program is the most commonly taken course. Learners represent 32 different countries across six continents. The IGOT portal also has surgical videos available on YouTube. The IGOT Portal YouTube channel has over 2000 subscribers and over 143,000 total views.
Conclusions: The IGOT Learning Portal is an innovative approach to address the global disparity in orthopaedic trauma care by improving access to high-quality surgical education for surgeons and trainees both in the US and internationally. The development of an interactive online forum may be a beneﬁcial addition to the Portal. Future directions include assessing content retention, participant interaction, and expanding existing content to other orthopaedic subspecialties.},

However, what is even more important is the awareness and familiarity of learners with different systems and their appropriate use in e-learning. Therefore, the present study was conducted to determine the satisfaction of learners with synchronous and asynchronous electronic learning systems during the COVID-19 period at Tehran University of Medical Sciences.
Methods  The present study was a descriptive-analytical study conducted cross-sectionally from the first semester of 2019–2020 academic year until the end of the second semester of 2021–2022 academic year, coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic. The sample size was determined to be 370 students and 650 staff members using the Krejcie and Morgan table. The face validity and reliability of the research tool, which was a researcher-made questionnaire, was confirmed. Considering a response rate of 75\%, 280 completed questionnaires were received from students, and 500 completed questionnaires were collected from employees. For data analysis, absolute and relative frequencies, as well as independent t-test, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and Post Hoc tests in the SPSS software were utilized.
Results  During the COVID-19 pandemic, both students and staff members at Tehran University of Medical Sciences showed a relatively decreasing level of satisfaction with electronic learning. There was a significant difference in satisfaction between these two groups of learners regarding electronic learning (P = 0/031). Learners were relatively more satisfied with the offline system called “Navid” compared to online learning systems. Among the online systems, the highest level of satisfaction was observed with the Skype platform.
Conclusion  Although learners expressed relative satisfaction with electronic learning during the COVID-19 period, it is necessary to strengthen infrastructure and provide support services, technical assistance, and continuous updates for electronic learning platforms.

	abstract = {Self-regulated learning (SRL) is an essential skill to achieve one's learning goals. This is particularly true for online learning environments (OLEs) where the support system is often limited compared to a traditional classroom setting. Likewise, existing research has found that learners often struggle to adapt their behaviour to the self-regulatory demands of OLEs. Even so, existing SRL analysis tools have limited utility for real-time or individualised support of a learner's SRL strategy during a study session. Accordingly, we explore a reinforcement learning based approach to learning optimal SRL strategies for a specific learning task. Specifically, we utilise the sequences of SRL processes acted by 44 participants, and their assessment scores for a prescribed learning task, in a purpose-built OLE to develop a long short-term memory (LSTM) network based reward function. This is used to train a reinforcement learning agent to find the optimal sequence of SRL processes for the learning task. Our findings indicate that the developed agents were able to effectively select SRL processes so as to maximise a prescribed learning goal as measured by predicted assessment score and predicted knowledge gains. The contributions of this work will facilitate the development of a tool which can detect sub-optimal SRL strategy in real-time and enable individualised SRL focused scaffolding. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Learners often fail to adequately adapt their behavior to the self-regulatory demands of e-Learning environments. In order to promote effective Self-regulated learning (SRL) capabilities, researchers and educators need tools that are able to analyze and diagnose a learner's SRL strategy use. Current methods for SRL analysis are more often descriptive as opposed to prescriptive and have limited utility for real-time analysis or support of a learner's SRL behavior. What this paper adds This paper proposes the use of Reinforcement Learning for prescriptive analytics of SRL. We train a Reinforcement Learning agent on sequences of SRL processes acted by learners in order to learn the optimal SRL strategy for a given learning task. Implications for practice and/or policy Our work will facilitate the development of a tool which can detect sub-optimal SRL strategy in real-time and enable individualized SRL focused scaffolding. The implications of our work can aid in course design by predicting the self-regulatory load imposed by a given task. The ability to model SRL strategies using Reinforcement Learning can be extended to simulate or test SRL theories.},

	abstract = {Background  Pandemic-induced restrictions forced curriculum transformation from on-site education to virtual learning options. This report describes this transition, the challenge of creating technology-enhanced learning for hands-on psychomotor skills teaching in physiotherapy, and students’ evaluations of the new technology-enhanced learning approach in Complex Decongestive Physiotherapy.
Methods  On-site theoretical background lectures were replaced with e-learning sessions. Faculty hands-on skills demonstrations for the entire class were replaced with video-recorded demonstrations. Videos included verbal and written instructions and were complemented with checklists guiding the students, training in pairs, through their learning tasks. A cross-sectional observational survey for teaching quality evaluated this new technology-enhanced learning approach and assessed students’ preference for traditional or video-based hands-on skills learning.
Results  Survey return rate was {\textgreater} 50\% (46 participating students). Teaching quality was rated between 1.5 ± 0.5 and 1.8 ± 0.4 (Likert scale from − 2 to + 2). Most students (66.7\%) preferred the new approach. They appreciated for example that videos were available all the time, enabling self-paced learning, providing an equally good view on skills demonstrations, and the convenience to be able to rewind, re-view, and use speed adjustment options.
Conclusions  Students preferred the new video-based learning of skills for Complex Decongestive Physiotherapy. Because in-class live skills demonstrations were omitted, faculty had more time to provide individual feedback and answer questions. The shift from teacher- to student-centered learning enabled students to control their own learning pace. The innovative program was maintained after pandemic-induced restrictions were lifted. The success of this approach should be tested in other physiotherapy settings and different educational institutions.},

	abstract = {Background  To intrinsically motivate students in the long term, longitudinal e-learning systems combined with repeated testing and competitive gamification seem promising. The effects of this approach have never been closely examined in the field of evidence-based medicine. The authors investigated if a simple, competitive learning application enhances students’ risk competence and intrinsic motivation.
Methods  Participants were 5.-9. semester medical students (n = 48), recruited in an elective evidence-based medicine subject and randomly distributed to two groups (group 1: n = 23; group 2: n = 25). Both accessed a competitive evidence-based medicine quiz game. Following a cross-over design, each group practiced with one of two thematically different questionnaires A or B, before the allocation switched after one month. To analyse whether there was a measurable learning effect in the practiced topics, a paired t-test was performed with quantitative data from 3 e-tests. Students further reported their experience in evaluation surveys.
Results  Students’ improvements in e-test scores after training with the corresponding topics in the learning application can be attributed to chance. Even though the majority enjoyed playing and felt motivated to study, they invested a minimum of time and rejected competition.
Conclusion  The authors found no evidence for benefits of the investigated learning programme on students’ risk competence or on their internal motivation. The majority disapproved the competitive concept, indicating adverse side effects of the applied gamification element. To intrinsically motivate more students, prospective learning programmes should favour complex and collaborative programmes over simple and competitive ones.},

Using a computer-supported collaborative learning environment has proven effective in achieving the learning objectives of the new curriculum in this field. The educational institutions offer the pharmacy internship course in the classroom and educational pharmacies in the presence of students. Because of Covid-19 restrictions, classes are being held online. Achieving the desired learning outcomes for this lesson can be challenging because of its practical and skill-based nature. As a result, creating customized learning experiences that align with the lesson’s objectives is crucial. This study was quasi-experimental and involved students who had selected an internship. The control group received traditional instruction, while the intervention group was taught using a combination of conventional education and an application. The learning outcomes were evaluated through learning and motivation tests using the MSLQ questionnaire. The intervention group had a mean score of 79 ± 0.117, while the control group had a mean score of 69 ± 0.195, showing that the intervention group had significantly higher learning (p {\textless} 0.05). Regarding motivation, the intervention group had a mean score of 110.4 ± 17.76, while the control group had a mean score of 113.94 ± 19.67, with no significant difference observed (p {\textgreater} 0.05). The application’s simulated pharmacy environment improved the conditions for trainees to read different prescription sheets, providing a realistic learning experience. Using the application increased students’ learning. Even though there was no significant variation in motivation between the two sets, students who used the app expressed a greater interest in education.},

	abstract = {Background  Tele-education is the use of ICTs to conduct remote learning. It has been utilized to deliver ongoing training for many years. The world’s modern culture is increasingly reliant on the use of information technology to enhance standards of education. However, in order to deploy successful e-learning systems in a developing nation, understanding of user characteristics is required in the creation and usage of e-learning systems. Thus, this study will enable us to understand the user’s level of knowledge and attitude towards tele-education.
Methods  An institution-based quantitative cross-sectional study supported by qualitative design was used 397 medical students at University of Gondar from May to June 2022. A pre-tested self-administered structured questionnaires and in-depth interview were used to collect quantitative and qualitative data respectively. Thematiccontent analysis was conducted using open-code software for analyzing qualitative data. Quantitative data was entered to Epi-data version 4.6 and exported to SPSS version 25 software for further statistical analysis. Binary logistic regression was conducted. The adjusted odds ratio(AOR) was used to measure the association between the dependent and independent variables.
Results  A total of 397 medical students were participated in this study with a response rate of 93.63\%. In this study nearly six out of ten 230(57.9\%) of study participants had good knowledge towards tele-education. More than half. 211(53.1\%) of medical students participated on the study also had a favorable attitude towards tele-education. Factors associated with knowledge about tele-education is training related to ICT (AOR = 2.27 95\% CI; (1.13,4.55)), knowledge of medical education digitization (AOR = 3.80 95\% CI; (2.12,6.84)), high computer literacy (AOR = 2.82 95\% CI; (1.68,4.72)) and favorable attitude towards tele-education (AOR = 3.52 95\% CI; (2.12,5.84)). Factors associated with attitude towards tele-education is age group {\textgreater} 21 (AOR = 3.89, 95\% CI; (1.33,11.39)) and good knowledge towards tele-education (AOR = 3.42,95\%CI;(2.06,5.66)).

We added motivational beliefs (growth mindset, self-efficacy, and task value) as associated variables and learning presence (online self-regulation) as a mediator and examined their contribution to students’ cognitive presence and empowerment. The participants were 539 junior middleschool students in rural China who had acquired significant online learning experience as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The results showed that motivational variables were associated with students’ social presence and online self-regulation, which in turn related to their cognitive presence and empowerment in the online learning environment. Growth mindset and self-efficacy also exhibited a significant correlation with students’ cognitive presence. There was a positive correlation between cognitive presence and empowerment. We also found teaching presence has a positive association with social presence but a negative association with online self-regulation. Our research provides a more comprehensive explanatory model of online instruction and student empowerment by introducing the elements of motivational beliefs and learning presence to the CoI framework.},

This study aims to investigate the combined effects of e-learning orientation, Moodle usage, and learning planning on learning outcomes in the context of on-demand lectures. A sample of participants from the Department of Information Science and Engineering in the Faculty of Engineering completed questionnaires related to e-learning orientation, while Moodle usage data and learning planning information were collected. Correlation, principal component, cluster, and multiple regression analysis were conducted to examine the relationships between variables and their impact on learning outcomes. The results suggest that e-learning orientation did not exert a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on learning outcomes. However, Moodle usage and learning planning emerged as crucial factors. Increased engagement with Moodle, as indicated by higher clicks and utilization of its learning functionalities, was associated with improved learning outcomes. Additionally, effective learning planning, characterized by adherence to schedules and timely submissions, positively inﬂuenced learning outcomes. The results emphasize the importance of considering multiple factors, not just a single factor, for successful online learning.

Methods: A cross-sectional online survey of medical students (N = 376) in six medical schools was carried out after their second semester, from August 15 to 20, 2020. Ten parameters were measured for the effectiveness of elearning based on a 5-point Likert-scale and five parameters were measured for satisfaction.
Results: e-learning was more or equally effective in four parameters such as assignment submission and meeting individual needs, but less effective in six parameters, including building skills and knowledge, and interaction level. Satisfaction was either high or neutral in all five parameters.
Conclusions: Our findings have shown that e-learning can assist the teaching process in medical schools in some respects, but cannot be used for the entire teaching process.},

Therefore, this scoping review was conducted aiming to identify and structure all published interventional studies that investigated dermatological teaching approaches with medical students. The methodology of this scoping review followed the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews. The databases Medline and Embase were searched without restriction until 30.06.2020. A categorization and a descriptive analysis of the studies published as full articles were performed. The database search yielded 36,627 hits. 114 studies met all inclusion criteria. These came from 19 countries, were mainly published since 2010 and were distributed across 64 different journals. 32 randomized controlled trials were identified. A wide variety of teaching approaches was found, including both E-learning and conventional teaching formats. The results of the studies are presented in structured tables. This scoping review documents a large number of studies published worldwide on teaching dermatology to medical students. The teaching of dermatology appears to be successful with numerous teaching approaches, whereby interventions that incorporate didactic principles were verifiably more successful. This literature review can serve as an aid for evidence-based teaching design in dermatology as well as a basis for future research approaches.},

	abstract = {Background:  E-learning has been widely adopted as a teaching and learning approach in medical education internationally. However, its adoption in low- and middle-income countries is still at an infantile stage. The use of e-learning may help to overcome some of the barriers to access to quality education and provide flexible, low-cost, user-centred, and easily updated learning. To address the need for research education during the COVID-19 pandemic, we developed and implemented an e-learning course for students enrolled in higher diploma courses at the Kenya Medical Training College (KMTC). In this paper, we report our experience teaching the online research course in resource-constrained settings to enable other medical educators, students and institutions in similar settings to understand the most appropriate approaches to incorporating e-learning interventions.
Methods:  This was a cross-sectional study that reviewed the experiences of learners and lecturers on a research course at Kenya Medical Training College. All higher diploma students admitted to the college in the 2020/21 academic year were invited to take part in the study. We also included all lecturers that were involved in the coordination and facilitation of the course. We analysed qualitative and quantitative data that were collected from the e-learning platform, an online course-evaluation form and reports from course lecturers.
Results:  We enrolled 933 students on the online research course. These students had joined 44 higher diploma courses in 11 campuses of the college. The students struggled to complete synchronous e-learning activities on the e-learning platform. Only 53 and 45\% of the students were able to complete the pretest and the posttest, respectively. Four themes were identified through a thematic analysis of qualitative data (1) Students gained research competencies (2) Students appreciated the use of diverse e-learning technologies (3) Students felt overwhelmed by the research course (4) Technological challenges reduce the effectiveness of online learning.
Conclusion:  Our results suggest that e-learning can be used to teach complex courses, such as research in resourceconstrained settings. However, faculty should include more asynchronous e-learning activities to enhance teaching and learning and improve student experiences.},

	abstract = {Background: General practitioners (GP) update their knowledge and skills by participating in continuing medical education (CME) programs either in a traditional or an e-Learning format. GPs’ beliefs about electronic format of CME have been studied but without an explicit theoretical framework which makes the findings difficult to interpret. In other health disciplines, researchers used theory of planned behavior (TPB) to predict user’s behavior.
Methods: In this study, an instrument was developed to investigate GPs’ intention to use e-Learning in CME based on TPB. The goodness of fit of TPB was measured using confirmatory factor analysis and the relationship between latent variables was assessed using structural equation modeling.
Results: A total of 148 GPs participated in the study. Most of the items in the questionnaire related well to the TPB theoretical constructs, and the model had good fitness. The perceived behavioral control and attitudinal constructs were included, and the subjective norms construct was excluded from the structural model. The developed questionnaire could explain 66 \% of the GPs’ intention variance.
Conclusions: The TPB could be used as a model to construct instruments that investigate GPs’ intention to participate in e-Learning programs in CME. The findings from the study will encourage CME managers and researchers to explore the developed instrument as a mean to explain and improve the GPs’ intentions to use eLearning in CME.},

	abstract = {Background: Patient safety (PS) is influenced by a set of factors on various levels of the healthcare system. Therefore, a systems-level approach and systems thinking is required to understand and improve PS. The use of e-learning may help to develop a systems thinking approach in medical students, as case studies featuring audiovisual media can be used to visualize systemic relationships in organizations. The goal of this quasi-experimental study was to determine if an e-learning can be utilized to improve systems thinking, knowledge, and attitudes towards PS.
Methods: A quasi-experimental, longitudinal within- subjects design was employed. Participants were 321 third-year medical students who received online surveys before and after they participated in an e-learning course on PS. Primary outcome measures where levels of systems thinking and attitudes towards PS. Secondary outcome measures were the improvement of PS specific knowledge through the e-learning course.
Results: Levels of systems thinking showed significant improvement (58.72 vs. 61.27; p {\textless} .001) after the e-learning. Student’s attitudes towards patient safety improved in several dimensions: After the course, students rated the influence of fatigue on safety higher (6.23 vs. 6.42, p {\textless} .01), considered patient empowerment more important (5.16 vs. 5.93, p {\textless} .001) and realized more often that human error is inevitable (5.75 vs. 5.97, p {\textless} .05). Knowledge on PS improved from 36.27 \% correct answers before to 76.45 \% after the e-learning (p {\textless} .001).
Conclusions: Our results suggest that e-learning can be used to teach PS. Attitudes towards PS improved on several dimensions. Furthermore, we were able to demonstrate that a specifically designed e-learning program can foster the development of conceptual frameworks such as systems thinking, which facilitates the understanding of complex socio-technical systems within healthcare organisations.},

Aim of the work: Design and evaluation of a new course concept in thoracic surgery to motivate students and at the same time ﬁnd ways to relieve the medical staﬀ in their teaching activities. Material and methods: All students of the third clinical semester at the University of Regensburg completed a case-based course on the topic of pulmonary nodules in the summer semester 2016 and winter semester 2016/2017 as part of the practical course in thoracic surgery. This involved a moderated face-to-face seminar for one group of students and a purely online event for the other group. The knowledge gain and the subjective learning experience of the students were evaluated via questionnaires.
Results: A total of 190 students took part in the courses, 88 in the face-to-face course and 102 in the online course. Although both groups recorded a signiﬁcant increase in knowledge as a result of the course intervention, the students in the face-to-face course showed signiﬁcantly higher subjective satisfaction compared to their peers in the online course.
Conclusion: Case-based learning was shown to be a promising concept in thoracic surgery education, although establishing online learning procedures proved to be more challenging than presence-based teaching.},

	abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has brought attention to the importance of correctly using personal protective equipment (PPE). Doffing is a critical phase that increases the risk of contamination of health care workers. Although a gamified electronic learning (e-learning) module has been shown to increase the adequate choice of PPE among prehospital personnel, it failed to enhance knowledge regarding donning and doffing sequences. Adding other training modalities such as face-to-face training to these e-learning tools is therefore necessary to increase prehospital staff proficiency and thus help reduce the risk of contamination.
Objective: The aim of this study is to assess the impact of the Peyton 4-step approach in addition to a gamified e-learning module for teaching the PPE doffing sequence to first-year paramedic students.
Methods: Participants will first follow a gamified e-learning module before being randomized into one of two groups. In the control group, participants will be asked to perform a PPE doffing sequence, which will be video-recorded to allow for subsequent assessment. In the experimental group, participants will first undergo face-to-face training performed by third-year students using the Peyton 4-step approach before performing the doffing sequence themselves, which will also be video-recorded. All participants will then be asked to reconstruct the doffing sequence on an online platform. The recorded sequences will be assessed independently by two investigators: a prehospital emergency medicine expert and an infection prevention and control specialist. The assessors will be blinded to group allocation. Four to eight weeks after this first intervention, all participants will be asked to record the doffing sequence once again for a subsequent skill retention assessment and to reconstruct the sequence on the same online platform to assess knowledge retention. Finally, participants belonging to the control group will follow face-to-face training.
Results: The study protocol has been presented to the regional ethics committee (Req-2020-01340), which issued a declaration of no objection as such projects do not fall within the scope of the Swiss federal law on human research. Study sessions were performed in January and February 2021 in Geneva, and will be performed in April and June 2021 in Bern.
Conclusions: This study should help to determine whether face-to-face training using the Peyton 4-step approach improves the application and knowledge retention of a complex procedure when combined with an e-learning module.},

	abstract = {Background: Concern has been raised that the COVID-19 pandemic and consequent social distancing measures may increase neuropsychiatric symptoms in people with dementia. Thus, we developed and delivered an e-learning training course to professional caregivers on using a web-based tool for psychosocial interventions for people with dementia.
Objective: The aim of our study was to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of an e-learning course in combination with a web-based tool in addressing neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia.
Methods: A quasi-experimental design was used in Tokyo, Japan. The e-learning course was delivered three times to professional caregivers between July and December 2020. Caregivers who completed the course assessed the level of neuropsychiatric symptoms in people with dementia using the total score from the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) via a web-based tool. The primary outcome measures were the number of caregivers who implemented follow-up NPI evaluations by March 2021 and the change in NPI scores from baseline to their most recent follow-up evaluations. As a control group, information was also obtained from professional caregivers who completed a face-to-face training course using the same web-based tool between July 2019 and March 2020.
Results: A total of 268 caregivers completed the e-learning course in 2020. Of the 268 caregivers, 56 (20.9\%) underwent follow-up evaluations with 63 persons with dementia. The average NPI score was significantly reduced from baseline (mean 20.4, SD 16.2) to the most recent follow-up evaluations (mean 14.3, SD 13.4). The effect size was assumed to be medium (Cohen drm [repeated measures]=0.40). The control group consisted of 252 caregivers who completed a face-to-face training course. Of the 252 caregivers, 114 (45.2\%) underwent follow-up evaluations. Compared to the control group, caregivers who completed the e-learning course were significantly less likely to implement follow-up evaluations (χ21=52.0, P{\textless}.001). The change in NPI scores did not differ according to the type of training course (baseline-adjusted difference=–0.61, P=.69).
Conclusions: The replacement of face-to-face training with e-learning may have provided professionals with an opportunity to participate in the dementia behavior analysis and support enhancement (DEMBASE) program who may not have participated in the program otherwise. Although the program showed equal efficacy in terms of the two training courses, the feasibility was},

During the pandemic, students have had no access to cadavers, which has been the principal method of learning anatomy. We created and tested a customized congenital heart disease e-learning course for medical students that contained interactive 3D models of anonymized pediatric congenital heart defects.
Objective: The aim of this study is to assess whether a multimodal e-learning course contributed to learning outcomes in a cohort of first-year undergraduate medical students studying congenital heart diseases. The secondary aim is to assess student attitudes and experiences associated with multimodal e-learning.
Methods: The pre-post study design involved 290 first-year undergraduate medical students. Recruitment was conducted by course instructors. Data were collected before and after using the course. The primary outcome was knowledge acquisition (test scores). The secondary outcomes included attitudes and experiences, time to complete the modules, and browser metadata.
Results: A total of 141 students were included in the final analysis.

Most students (108/122, 88.3\%) were highly motivated to learn with the course, and most (114/122, 93.5\%) reported positive experiences with the course. There was a strong correlation between attitudes and experiences, which was statistically significant (rs=0.687; P{\textless}.001; n=122). No relationships were found between the change in test scores and attitudes (P=.70) or experiences (P=.47). Students most frequently completed the e-learning course with Chrome (109/141, 77.3\%) and on Apple macOS (86/141, 61\%) or Windows 10 (52/141, 36.9\%). Most students (117/141, 83\%) had devices with high-definition screens. Most students (83/141, 58.9\%) completed the course in {\textless}3 hours.
Conclusions: Multimodal e-learning could be a viable solution in improving learning outcomes and experiences for undergraduate medical students who do not have access to cadavers. Future research should focus on validating long-term learning outcomes.},

	abstract = {Background: Clinical nursing education provides opportunities for students to learn in multiple patient care settings, receive appropriate guidance, and foster the development of clinical competence and professionalism. Nurse preceptors guide students to integrate theory into practice, teach clinical skills, assess clinical competencies, and enhance problem-solving and critical thinking skills. Previous research has indicated that the teaching competencies of nurse preceptors can be transferred to students? clinical learning to enhance their clinical competencies. Objective: This study aimed to develop a clinical teaching blended learning (CTBL) program with the aid of web-based clinical pedagogy (WCP) and case-based learning for nurse preceptors and to examine the effectiveness of the CTBL program on nurse preceptors? clinical teaching competencies, self-efficacies, attitudes toward web-based learning, and blended learning outcomes. Methods: A quasi-experimental single-group pretest and posttest design was adopted. A total of 150 nurse preceptors participated in the CTBL program, which was conducted from September 2019 to December 2019. A set of questionnaires, including the clinical teaching competence inventory, preceptor self-efficacy questionnaire, attitudes toward web-based continuing learning survey, and e-learning experience questionnaire, was used to assess the outcomes before and after the CTBL program. Results: Compared with the baseline, the participants had significantly higher total mean scores and subdomain scores for clinical teaching competence (mean 129.95, SD 16.38; P{\textless}.001), self-efficacy (mean 70.40, SD 9.35; P{\textless}.001), attitudes toward web-based continuing learning (mean 84.68, SD 14.76; P{\textless}.001), and blended learning outcomes (mean 122.13, SD 14.86; P{\textless}.001) after the CTBL program. Conclusions: The CTBL program provides a comprehensive coverage of clinical teaching pedagogy and assessment strategies. The combination of the WCP and case-based approach provides a variety of learning modes to fit into the diverse learning needs of the preceptors. The CTBL program allows the preceptors to receive direct feedback from the facilitators during face-to-face sessions. Preceptors also gave feedback that the web-based workload is manageable. This study provides evidence that the CTBL program increases the clinical teaching competencies and self-efficacies of the preceptors and promotes positive attitudes toward web-based learning and better blended learning outcomes. The health care organization can consider the integration of flexible learning and intellect platforms for preceptorship education.},

	abstract = {Background: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has led to increased use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Adequate use of this equipment is more critical than ever because the risk of shortages must be balanced against the need to effectively protect health care workers, including prehospital personnel. Specific training is therefore necessary; however, the need for social distancing has markedly disrupted the delivery of continuing education courses. Electronic learning (e-learning) may provide significant advantages because it requires neither the physical presence of learners nor the repetitive use of equipment for demonstration. Objective: Inclusion of game mechanics, or ?gamification,? has been shown to increase knowledge and skill acquisition. The objective of this research was to develop a gamified e-learning module to interactively deliver concepts and information regarding the correct choice and handling of PPE. Methods: The SERES framework was used to define and describe the development process, including scientific and design foundations. After we defined the target audience and learning objectives by interviewing the stakeholders, we searched the scientific literature to establish relevant theoretical bases. The learning contents were validated by infection control and prehospital experts. Learning mechanics were then determined according to the learning objectives, and the content that could benefit from the inclusion of game mechanics was identified. Results: The literature search resulted in the selection and inclusion of 12 articles. In addition to gamification, pretesting, feedback, avoiding content skipping, and demonstrations using embedded videos were used as learning mechanics. Gamification was used to enhance the interactivity of the PPE donning and doffing sequences, which presented the greatest learning challenges. The module was developed with Articulate Storyline 3 to ensure that it would be compatible with a wide array of devices, as this software generates HTML5-compatible output that can be accessed on smartphones, tablets, and regular computers as long as a recent browser is available. Conclusions: A gamified e-learning module designed to promote better knowledge and understanding of PPE use among prehospital health care workers was created by following the SERES framework. The impact of this module should now be assessed by means of a randomized controlled trial.},

	abstract = {Background: In Geneva, Switzerland, basic life support (BLS) maneuvers are provided in only 40\% of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCAs) cases. As OHCA outcomes are markedly improved when BLS maneuvers are swiftly applied, a ?first-responder? system was introduced in 2019. When emergency dispatchers identify a possible OHCA, first responders receive an alert message on a specific app (Save-a-Life) installed on their smartphones. Those nearest to the victim and immediately available are sent the exact location of the intervention. First-year medical students only have limited knowledge regarding BLS procedures but might nevertheless need to take care of OHCA victims. Medical students responding to out-of-hospital emergencies are off-duty in half of these situations, and offering junior medical students the opportunity to enlist as first responders might therefore not only improve OHCA outcomes but also foster a greater recognition of the role medical students can hold in our society. Objective: Our aim is to determine whether providing first-year medical students with a short intervention followed by an interactive e-learning module can motivate them to enlist as first responders. Methods: After obtaining the approval of the regional ethics committee and of the vice-dean for undergraduate education of the University of Geneva Faculty of Medicine (UGFM), 2 senior medical students will present the project to their first-year colleagues at the beginning of a lecture. First-year students will then be provided with a link to an interactive e-learning module which has been designed according to the Swiss Resuscitation Council?s first aid guidelines. After answering a first questionnaire and completing the module, students will be able to register for practice sessions. Those attending and successfully completing these sessions will receive a training certificate which will enable them to enlist as first responders. The primary outcome will be the proportion of first-year medical students enlisting as first responders at the end of the study period. Secondary outcomes will be the proportion of first-year medical students electing to register on the platform, to begin the e-learning module, to complete the e-learning module, to register for practice sessions, to attend the practice sessions, and to obtain a certificate. The reasons given by medical students for refusing to participate will be analyzed. We will also assess how comfortable junior medical students would feel to be integrated into the first responders system at the end of the training program and whether it affects the registration rate. Results: The regional ethics committee (Req-2020-01143) and the UGFM vice-dean for undergraduate education have given their approval to the realization of this study, which is scheduled to begin in January 2021. Conclusions: This study should determine whether a short intervention followed by an interactive e-learning module can motivate first-year medical students to enlist as first responders.

	abstract = {Background: To avoid misuse of personal protective equipment (PPE), ensure health care workers? safety, and avoid shortages, effective communication of up-to-date infection control guidelines is essential. As prehospital teams are particularly at risk of contamination given their challenging work environment, a specific gamified electronic learning (e-learning) module targeting this audience might provide significant advantages as it requires neither the presence of learners nor the repetitive use of equipment for demonstration. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether a gamified e-learning module could improve the rate of adequate PPE choice by prehospital personnel in the context of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods: This was an individual-level randomized, controlled, quadruple-blind (investigators, participants, outcome assessors, and data analysts) closed web-based trial. All emergency prehospital personnel working in Geneva, Switzerland, were eligible for inclusion, and were invited to participate by email in April 2020. Participants were informed that the study aim was to assess their knowledge regarding PPE, and that they would be presented with both the guidelines and the e-learning module, though they were unaware that there were two different study paths. All participants first answered a preintervention quiz designed to establish their profile and baseline knowledge. The control group then accessed the guidelines before answering a second set of questions, and were then granted access to the e-learning module. The e-learning group was shown the e-learning module right after the guidelines and before answering the second set of questions. Results: Of the 291 randomized participants, 176 (60.5\%) completed the trial. There was no significant difference in baseline knowledge between groups. Though the baseline proportion of adequate PPE choice was high (75\%, IQR 50\%-75\%), participants? description of the donning sequence was in most cases incorrect. After either intervention, adequate choice of PPE increased significantly in both groups (P{\textless}.001). Though the median of the difference in the proportion of correct answers was slightly higher in the e-learning group (17\%, IQR 8\%-33\% versus 8\%, IQR 8\%-33\%), the difference was not statistically significant (P=.27). Confidence in the ability to use PPE was maintained in the e-learning group (P=.27) but significantly decreased in the control group (P=.04). Conclusions: Among prehospital personnel with an already relatively high knowledge of and experience with PPE use, both web-based study paths increased the rate of adequate choice of PPE. There was no major added value of the gamified e-learning module apart from preserving participants' confidence in their ability to correctly use PPE.},

	abstract = {The use of E-learning in higher education is no matter of course. Many different experiences in projects implementing E-learning at universities have demonstrated that. One of the influential factors that is responsible for the sustainable use of E-learning in higher education teaching are the competences of the university teachers to use the new media to conduct a didactically well designed course and to achieve additional values for learning and teaching using E-learning. With reference to this background and in the context of a big research and development project to spread and perpetuate E-learning at the University of Paderborn a structural competence model to describe E-teaching competences of university teachers was developed. The main goal of this model was to develop and implement measures of competence development in a needs oriented way. The competence model allows the well-founded and differentiated description of competence requirements for different E-learning scenarios and also the deduction of needs oriented competence development measures. The article describes how the structural competence model with eight dimensions, 39 sub-dimensions and 283 competence facets (including knowledge, ability and motivational/attitudinal facets) was developed and formulated with reference to theoretical conceptions of the domain and additional empirical steps. Furthermore, the model of E-teaching was validated with the help of empirical steps concerning the content, structural and criteria oriented validation of the model. The methods to raise the data and to statistically analyze them are reported to demonstrate the validation process.},

	abstract = {In recent days, learners faced difficulties learning programming courses. This research study will help the learners learn complex concepts quickly with different activities like flipped classrooms, online quizzes, learning by doing, and a virtual laboratory. This research is carried out to address the difficulties of learners and cover all the domains of learning, including knowledge, Skill, and Attitude. The fuzzy logic method has recently been applied in education to overcome these restrictions. While employing the fuzzy logic approach to evaluate student achievement, qualifications are assessed qualitatively rather than quantitatively. This research study applies Fuzzy Logic in the first stage, Factor Analysis (FA), and Machine Learning (ML) techniques in the second stage to discover essential factors associated with the effective use of Active Learning Strategies (ALS) in the Learning Management System (LMS) of information technology course learners. Fuzzy logic and neural network topology can be coupled using ANFIS, an adaptable network. FA is performed to find the critical factors for successful learners. The study compares the performance of five supervised machine learning algorithms: KNearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Discriminant Analysis, and Support Vector Machine. These classifiers are evaluated to determine their suitability and model fit in the context of the research. In this study, real-time data is collected from B.Tech Information Technology learners. The following prediction models achieved high accuracy before FA analysis: Naive Bayes (90 \%), Support Vector Machine (89 \%), Discriminant Analysis (88 \%), Decision Tree (86 \%), and K-Nearest Neighbors (82 \%). Naive Bayes gives the best accuracy, with 90 \%. Following factor analysis (FA), the accuracy achieved by various classifiers is as follows: Naive Bayes 92 \%, K-Nearest Neighbors - 92 \%, Support Vector Machine - 90 \%, Discriminant Analysis - 89 \%, and Decision Tree - 88 \%. Among these, Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbors exhibit the highest accuracy of 92 \%.},

Objective: We describe the development of a free and globally accessible multilingual e-learning module that provides education material on topics in pediatric endocrinology and diabetes and that is intended for first-line physicians and health workers but also trainees or medical specialists in resource-limited countries.
Methods: As complements to concise chapters, interactive vignettes were constructed, exemplifying clinical issues and pitfalls, with specific attention to the 3 levels of medical health care in resource-limited countries. The module is part of a large e-learning portal, ESPE e-learning, which is based on ILIAS (Integriertes Lern-, Informations- und Arbeitskooperations-System), an open-source web-based learning management system. Following a review by global experts, the content was translated by native French, Spanish, Swahili, and Chinese–speaking colleagues into their respective languages using a commercial web-based translation tool (SDL Trados Studio).
Results: Preliminary data suggest that the module is well received, particularly in targeted parts of the world and that active promotion to inform target users is warranted.
Conclusions: The e-learning module is a free globally accessible multilingual up-to-date tool for use in resource-limited countries that has been utilized thus far with success. Widespread use will require dissemination of the tool on a global scale.},

This study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of blended learning in promoting the clinical skills of nursing students.
Methods: In this quasi-experimental study, 76 nursing students in the Sirjan School of Medical Sciences were entered through the census method in 2019 and 2020. They were allocated to intervention (n = 36) and control (n = 40) groups based on their academic year. Those who entered university in 2017 (control group) revived standard education, while the students of 2018 (intervention group) received blended clinical training, which included podcasts, vodcasts (40\%), and standard training in the clinical courses of adult-geriatric nursing three and critical care nursing. Students’ performance was evaluated through an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) method. Data were collected using a researchermade checklist after assessing its validity and reliability. Data were analyzed using descriptive and analytical statistics (chi-square, independent sample t test, and paired t test) by SPSS-19.
Results: There was not any significant difference between the scores of clinical skills in the control group before (2.15 ± 0.48) and after (2.44 ± 0.29) the intervention (P = 0.58), but there were significant differences between the scores of clinical skills in the intervention group before (2.28 ± 0.31) and after (3.22 ± 0.16) the intervention and also between the scores of the two groups, in all subscales after the intervention (P {\textless} 0.001).
Conclusion: The study results highlighted the need for using blended-learning methods and appropriate technology to help nursing students achieve their clinical skill learning goals in clinical settings.},

The intention of employees in using e-learning, however, is influenced by various factors. In this study, the influence of external factors on the acceptance of online training was examined in an operational context according to the General Extended Technology Acceptance Model for E-Learning. In this model, computer experience, computer self-efficacy, computer anxiety, perceived enjoyment, and subjective norm were included as important external factors that have been shown to be relevant in numerous empirical studies. In operational contexts, few studies to date have investigated the acceptance model and even less in Europe or Germany. To investigate the influence of external factors, data of 113 employees from a medical institution were collected after participation in an online training course by means of an online questionnaire and were evaluated by regression analyses. The predictors computer experience, perceived enjoyment, and subjective norm were the strongest predictors of perceived usefulness (R2 = 0.59 of the complete model). The perceived ease of use was best explained by the factors computer experience, computer self-efficacy, computer anxiety, and enjoyment (R2 = 0.43 of the complete model).

	abstract = {This study investigated the seamless mobile learning practices of UK government workers at various life stages, to understand how context impacted decisions about how, when and where learning was undertaken. Following Hedegaard, the context was understood as involving settings embedded within institutions. Drawing on analysis of data from public domain blogs and reports and anonymised trace data showing e-learning visits via a mobile device, a picture of institutional practice and values was developed. Against this backdrop, a survey of 50 individuals followed by semi-structured interviews provided information about seamless mobile learning projects. Mobile learning was often fragmented and ad hoc, rather than part of a longer, seamless learning project. A distinction between just-in-time learning and just-in-case learning was apparent, with the latter often postponed. For mobile workers, mobile learning focused on current work setting, whereas workers who could work in many interchangeable settings might move to somewhere they could concentrate. Mobile learning was sometimes motivated by a sense of a lack of time and a need to stay ‘on top of things’ as much as by interest in a topic. Sustained seamless mobile learning projects occurred if there was institutional support for learning that was also of individual interest and if learners had the ability to orchestrate their learning. Learners reported these seamless mobile learning projects to be enjoyable and compelling. This paper contributes to the evidence of seamless mobile learning practice over the life course and illustrates the value of considering an individual's relation to various institutions in conceptualisations of seamless mobile learning. It also offers pointers for the future design of seamless mobile learning tools including a need to offer learners the opportunity to sometimes separate ongoing learning which is related to distinct institutions.Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Mobile devices accompany their owners across settings that were previously considered separate, such as work, college and households. This has the potential to impact work/home and other boundaries. From a pedagogical perspective, mobile devices may support seamless learning, in which experiences across distinct settings result in a holistic and unified understanding. What this paper adds It introduces the concept of the institution to conceptions of seamless learning. It illustrates the ways in which different institutions (workplaces or educational institutions) can shape individual experiences and decisions about when and where to learn. It provides evidence that some working adults engage in seamless learning projects and describe this as compelling and enjoyable, but that others prefer to separate distinct life spheres. Implications for practice and/or policy There may be value in institutions and designers supporting people who want to engage in seamless mobile learning. However, it is important to be aware that not everyone wants to engage in seamless learning. Seamless learning is more likely to occur when individual and institutional priorities are aligned across several institutions, so there will be challenges for a single institution seeking to promote it.},

	abstract = {Background  In recent years, the subspecialty of neuropalliative care has emerged with the goal of improving the quality of life of patients suffering from neurological disease, though gaps remain in neuropalliative care education and training. E-learning has been described as a way to deliver interactive and facilitated lower-cost learning to address global gaps in medical care. We describe here the development of a novel, international, hybrid, and asynchronous curriculum with both self-paced modules and class-based lectures on neuropalliative care topics designed for the neurologist interested in palliative care, the palliative care physician interested in caring for neurological patients, and any other physician or advanced care providers interested in neuropalliative care. Methods  The course consisted of 12 modules, one per every four weeks, beginning July 2022. Each module is based on a case and relevant topics. Course content was divided into three streams (Neurology Basics, Palliative Care Basics, and Neuropalliative Care Essentials) of which two were optional and one was mandatory, and consisted of classroom sessions, webinars, and an in-person skills session. Evaluation of learners consisted of multiple choice questions and written assignments for each module. Evaluation of the course was based on semi-structured qualitative interviews conducted with both educator and learner, the latter of which will be published separately. Audio files were transcribed and underwent thematic analysis. For the discussion of the results, Khan’s e-learning framework was used. Results  Ten of the 12 participating educators were interviewed. Of the educators, three identified as mid-career and seven as senior faculty, ranging from six to 33 years of experience. Nine of ten reported an academic affiliation and all reported association with a teaching hospital. Themes identified from the educators’ evaluations were: bridging the global gap, getting everybody on board, defining the educational scope, investing extensive hours of voluntary time and resources, benefiting within and beyond the curriculum, understanding the learner’s experience, creating a community of shared learning, adapting future teaching and learning strategies, and envisioning long term sustainability.},

Online quizzes are a useful learning tool, particularly when courses are delivered online, thanks to technical advancements in web-based delivery. The greatest aspect of offering online quizzes is that the correct answer and any suitable comments are offered to students instantly after they complete a question. The present study evaluates students’ overall performance in one of the core courses, in which self-assessment quizzes were administered through the e-learning system in order to reflect their learning behaviour towards the coursework. As part of formative assessment, it was noted that students’ frequent efforts aggregated during the final exam session; yet, as soon as the quizzes were made available, a few students took them. The data demonstrated a substantial link between students who took the quizzes and their overall achievement as measured by final grades. This paper delves through the essential factors to consider when developing well-crafted quizzes for technical courses and so maximising their potential as an effective learning tool.},

Demographics and outcomes were analysed using chi-squared tests and regression models.
Results: There were 90,265 ALS participants (51,464 pre-; 38,801 post-) and 368,140 ILS participants (225,628 pre-; 142,512 post-). There was a sharp decline in participants on ALS/ILS courses due to COVID-19. ALS participant numbers rebounded to exceed pre-pandemic levels, whereas ILS numbers recovered to a lesser degree with increased uptake of e-learning versions. Mean ALS course participants reduced from 20.0 to 14.8 post-pandemic (P {\textless} 0.001). Post-pandemic there were small but statistically significant decreases in ALS Cardiac Arrest Simulation Test pass rates (from 82.1 \% to 80.1 \% (OR = 0.90, 95 \% CI = 0.86–0.94, P {\textless} 0.001)), ALS MCQ score (from 86.6 \% to 86.0 \% (mean difference = -0.35, 95 \% CI À0.44 to À0.26, P {\textless} 0.001)), and overall ALS course results (from 95.2 \%to 94.7 \%, OR = 0.92, CI = 0.85–0.99, P = 0.023). ILS course outcomes were similar post-pandemic (from 99.4 \% to 99.4 \%, P = 0.037).
Conclusion: COVID-19 caused a sharp decline in the number of participants on ALS/ILS courses and an accelerated uptake of e-learning versions, with the average ALS course size reducing significantly. The small reduction in performance on ALS courses requires further research to clarify the contributing factors.},

	abstract = {E-learning implementation is growing alongside the e-learning market’s growth. As a result, competing models and approaches were proposed to improve e-learning and learner performance; one of these models is the e-learning systems success model. In order to expand this model, an analysis of the published e-learning models and frameworks in the period 2017–2022 was conducted using the aggregative review method. 37 studies that match the current study interests have been selected and analyzed. The main results support the e-learning system success model. In addition to further constructs other than those used in the model that have been used to enhance it, an adaptive e-learning success model has been proposed, which integrates the e-learning success model with the other models and frameworks proposed in the literature. This study recommends that achieving e-learning success requires an analysis of the internal and external environment and crafting an adaptation plan to determine the e-learning methods depending on the pedagogical approaches and tutors’ and learners’ abilities and characteristics, which in turn determine the instructional material required and assessment methods, besides the required ICT. Besides the required enhancements, such as tutor and learner training, as well as the institution’s policy and e-learning management, in addition to the required adaptations to cope with environmental factors in order to embrace learners in education policies and future strategies.},

	abstract = {In the last years, Learning Management systems (LMSs) are acquiring great importance in online education, since they offer flexible integration platforms for organising a vast amount of learning resources, as well as for establishing effective communication channels between teachers and learners, at any direction. These online platforms are then attracting an increasing number of users that continuously access, download/upload resources and interact each other during their teaching/learning processes, which is even accelerating by the breakout of COVID-19. In this context, academic institutions are generating large volumes of learning-related data that can be analysed for supporting teachers in lesson, course or faculty degree planning, as well as administrations in university strategic level. However, managing such amount of data, usually coming from multiple heterogeneous sources and with attributes sometimes reflecting semantic inconsistencies, constitutes an emerging challenge, so they require common definition and integration schemes to easily fuse them, with the aim of efficiently feeding machine learning models. In this regard, semantic web technologies arise as a useful framework for the semantic integration of multi-source e-learning data, allowing the consolidation, linkage and advanced querying in a systematic way. With this motivation, the e-LION (e-Learning Integration ONtology) semantic model is proposed for the first time in this work to operate as data consolidation approach of different e-learning knowledge-bases, hence leading to enrich on-top analysis. For demonstration purposes, the proposed ontological model is populated with real-world private and public data sources from different LMSs referring university courses of the Software Engineering degree of the University of Malaga (Spain) and the Open University Learning. In this regard, a set of four case studies are worked for validation, which comprise advance semantic querying of data for feeding predictive modelling and time-series forecasting of students’ interactions according to their final grades, as well as the generation of SWRL reasoning rules for student’s behaviour classification. The results are promising and lead to the possible use of e-LION as ontological mediator scheme for the integration of new future semantic models in the domain of e-learning.},

	abstract = {Background: Public universities in Saudi Arabia today are making substantial investments in e-learning as part of their educational system, especially in the implementation of learning management systems (LMS). To our knowledge, this is the first study conducted in Saudi Arabia exploring medical students’ experience with an LMS, particularly as part of a medical informatics course.
Objective: This study investigates students’ use of various features of the LMS embedded in a recently implemented medical informatics course.
Methods: A mixed methodology approach was employed. Survey questionnaires were distributed to all third year medical informatics students at the end of the course. In addition, two focus group sessions were conducted with twelve students. A thematic analysis of the focus group was performed.
Results: A total of 265 third year medical student surveys (167/265, 63\% male and 98/265, 37\% female) were completed and analyzed. Overall, 50.6\% (134/265) of the students agreed that the course was well planned and up-to-date, had clearly stated objectives and clear evaluation methods, appropriate course assignment, and that the LMS offered easy navigation. Most of the students rated the course as good/fair overall. In general, females were 10.4\% more likely to prefer the LMS, as revealed by higher odd ratios (odds ratio [OR] 1.104, 95\% CI 0.86-1.42) compared to males. Survey results showed that students’ use of LMS tools increased after taking the course compared to before taking the course. The full model containing all items were statistically significant (χ225=69.52, P{\textless}.001, n=243), indicating that the model was able to distinguish between students who had positive attitudes towards LMS and those who did not. The focus group, however, revealed that the students used social networking for general use rather than learning purposes, but they were using other Internet resources and mobile devices for learning. Male students showed a higher preference for using technology in general to enhance learning activities. Overall, medical student attitudes towards the LMS were generally positive. Students also wanted a reminder and notification tool to help them stay updated with course events. Interestingly, a subset of students had been running a parallel LMS of their own that has features worth exploring and could be integrated with an official LMS in the future.
Conclusions: To our knowledge, this was the first time that an LMS was used in a medical informatics course. Students showed interest in adapting various LMS tools to enhance their learning and gained more knowledge through familiarity with the tool.},

	abstract = {Background: To qualitatively explore physiotherapy students’ perceptions of online e-learning for chronic disease management using a previously developed, innovative and interactive, evidence-based, e-learning package: Rheumatoid Arthritis for Physiotherapists e-Learning (RAP-eL).
Methods: Physiotherapy students participated in three focus groups in Perth, Western Australia. Purposive sampling was employed to ensure maximum heterogeneity across age, gender and educational background. To explore students’ perspectives on the advantages and disadvantages of online e-learning, ways to enhance e-learning, and information/ learning gaps in relation to interdisciplinary management of chronic health conditions, a semi-structured interview schedule was developed. Verbatim transcripts were analysed using inductive methods within a grounded theory approach to derive key themes.
Results: Twenty-three students (78 \% female; 39 \% with previous tertiary qualification) of mean (SD) age 23 (3.6) years participated. Students expressed a preference for a combination of both online e-learning and lecture-style learning formats for chronic disease management, citing flexibility to work at one’s own pace and time, and access to comprehensive information as advantages of e-learning learning. Personal interaction and ability to clarify information immediately were considered advantages of lecture-style formats. Perceived knowledge gaps included practical application of interdisciplinary approaches to chronic disease management and developing and implementing physiotherapy management plans for people with chronic health conditions.
Conclusions: Physiotherapy students preferred multi-modal and blended formats for learning about chronic disease management. This study highlights the need for further development of practically-oriented knowledge and skills related to interdisciplinary care for people with chronic conditions among physiotherapy students. While RAP-eL focuses on rheumatoid arthritis, the principles of learning apply to the broader context of chronic disease management.},

	abstract = {With e-learning rapidly gaining popularity, evaluating its effectiveness and efficiency has become a challenge in public education, the public sector, and the corporate sector. Measuring knowledge transfer is crucial in any learning process, but e-learning lacks validated methods for this. Here we examine ways to evaluate that particularly in case of e-learning, conducting a literature review to assess available measurement solutions, developing an evaluation method for knowledge transfer, and validating the method. Using logged data from e-courses, it is possible to assess the knowl­ edge transfer in e-learning. We describe a novel method for classifying effectiveness and effi­ ciency with measured values and measurement instruments. The new measurement method was aligned with a data set of an existing learning management system, and the effectiveness and efficiency of knowledge transfer was analysed using quantitative means, including descriptive statistics, regression modelling, and cluster analysis based on a specific e-learning course. This newly elaborated and validated knowledge transfer measurement technique could be a useful tool for anyone wanting to evaluate e-learning courses and can also serve as a baseline for academics to further develop or implement it on larger empirical datasets.},

	doi = {10.2196/mededu.9551},
	abstract = {Background: Although most physicians in medical settings have to deliver bad news, the skills of delivering bad news to patients have been given insufficient attention. Delivering bad news is a complex communication task that includes verbal and nonverbal skills, the ability to recognize and respond to patients? emotions and the importance of considering the patient?s environment such as culture and social status. How bad news is delivered can have consequences that may affect patients, sometimes over the long term. Objective: This project aimed to develop a Web-based formative self-assessment tool for physicians to practice delivering bad news to minimize the deleterious effects of poor way of breaking bad news about a disease, whatever the disease. Methods: BReaking bAD NEws Tool (BRADNET) items were developed by reviewing existing protocols and recommendations for delivering bad news. We also examined instruments for assessing patient-physician communications and conducted semistructured interviews with patients and physicians. From this step, we selected specific themes and then pooled these themes before consensus was achieved on a good practices communication framework list. Items were then created from this list. To ensure that physicians found BRADNET acceptable, understandable, and relevant to their patients? condition, the tool was refined by a working group of clinicians familiar with delivering bad news. The think-aloud approach was used to explore the impact of the items and messages and why and how these messages could change physicians? relations with patients or how to deliver bad news. Finally, formative self-assessment sessions were constructed according to a double perspective of progression: a chronological progression of the disclosure of the bad news and the growing difficulty of items (difficulty concerning the expected level of self-reflection). Results: The good practices communication framework list comprised 70 specific issues related to breaking bad news pooled into 8 main domains: opening, preparing for the delivery of bad news, communication techniques, consultation content, attention, physician emotional management, shared decision making, and the relationship between the physician and the medical team. After constructing the items from this list, the items were extensively refined to make them more useful to the target audience, and one item was added. BRADNET contains 71 items, each including a question, response options, and a corresponding message, which were divided into 8 domains and assessed with 12 self-assessment sessions. The BRADNET Web-based platform was developed according to the cognitive load theory and the cognitive theory of multimedia learning. Conclusions: The objective of this Web-based assessment tool was to create a ?space? for reflection. It contained items leading to self-reflection and messages that introduced recommended communication behaviors. Our approach was innovative as it provided an inexpensive distance-learning self-assessment tool that was manageable and less time-consuming for physicians with often overwhelming schedules.},

	abstract = {Background: Motivational interviewing (MI) is an established communication method for enhancing intrinsic motivation for changing health behavior. E-learning can reduce the cost and time involved in providing continuing education and can be easily integrated into individual working arrangements and the daily routines of medical professionals. Thus, a Web-based course was devised to familiarize health professionals with different levels of education and expertise with MI techniques for patients with chronic conditions. Objective: The aim of this study was to report participants? opinion on the practicality of MI (as learned in the course) in daily practice, stratified by the level of education. Methods: Participants (N=607) of the MI Web-based training course evaluated the course over 18 months, using a self-administered questionnaire. The evaluation was analyzed descriptively and stratified for the level of education (medical students, physicians in specialist training [PSTs], and general practitioners [GPs]). Results: Participants rated the applicability of the skills and knowledge gained by the course as positive (medical students: 94\% [79/84] good; PSTs: 88.6\% [109/123] excellent; and GPs: 51.3\% [182/355] excellent). When asked whether they envisage the use of MI in the future, 79\% (67/84) of the students stated to a certain extent, 88.6\% (109/123) of the PSTs stated to a great extent, and 38.6\% (137/355) of GPs stated to a great extent. Participants acknowledged an improvement of communication skills such as inviting (medical students: 85\% [72/84]; PSTs: 90.2\% [111/123]; GPs: 37.2\% [132/355]) and encouraging (medical students: 81\% [68/84]; PSTs: 45.5\% [56/123]; GPs: 36.3\% [129/355]) patients to talk about behavior change and conveying respect for patient?s choices (medical students: 72\% [61/84]; PSTs: 50.0\% [61/123]; GPs: 23.4\% [83/355]). Conclusions: Participants confirmed the practicality of MI. However, the extent to which the practicality of MI was acknowledged as well as its expected benefits depended on the individual?s level of education/expertise.},

	abstract = {Although educational computer games have been recognized as being a promising approach, previous studies have indicated that, without supportive models, students might only show temporary interest during the game-based learning process, and their learning performance is often not as good as expected. Therefore, in this paper, a twotier test approach is proposed for developing educational computer games. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, a role-playing game was developed and an experiment was conducted on the ‘‘migratory bird identiﬁcation’’ unit of an elementary school natural science course. Two classes of ﬁfth graders participated in the experiment. One class was the experimental group who learned with the proposed game-based learning approach. The other class was the control group who learned with the conventional e-learning approach. The experimental results showed that the proposed approach not only signiﬁcantly promoted the students’ learning motivation, but also improved their learning achievements. Moreover, it was found that the students who learned with the educational computer game showed signiﬁcantly higher technology acceptance degree than those who learned with the conventional e-learning approach. Accordingly, it is concluded that the proposed digital game-based learning approach is effective.},

Recent studies have shown remarkable increases in diabetes during the last decade. This has attracted many researchers and doctors to investigate e-learning technologies as a way of assisting people with diabetes. However very little work exist that focus on educating children to adopt healthy lifestyle. As a result, this research work aims to create awareness of diabetes among children, and thereby, ultimately contribute to reducing the growing rate of diabetes. This paper presents an investigation into E-Learning systems and how it can help people with diabetes, especially when it comes to children who are largely unaware and poorly informed about the menace of the disease. This research addresses children’ needs expectations, and proposes a design of an E-Learning prototype that can raise their awareness and knowledge in order to help reduce the effects of this disease on children.},

The advent of technology linking the real and virtual worlds has facilitated the transmission of spatial audio and haptics to allow the metaverse to offer multisensory experiences in diverse fields, especially in teaching. The main idea of the proposed project is the development of a simple intelligent system for meta-learning. The suggested system should be self-configurable according to the different users of the metaverse. We aimed to design and create a virtual learning environment using Open Simulator based on a 3D virtual environment and simulation of the real-world environment. We then connected this environment to a learning management system (Moodle) through technology for 3D virtual environments (Sloodle) to allow the management of students, especially those with different abilities, and followed up on their activities, tests, and exams. This environment also has the advantage of storing educational content. We evaluated the performance of the Open Simulator in both standalone and grid modes based on the login times. The result showed times the standalone and grid modes of 12 s and 16 s, which demonstrated the robustness of the proposed platform. We also tested the system on 50 disabled learners, according to the
              t
              -test of independent samples. A test was conducted in the mathematics course, in which the students were divided into two equal groups (n = 25 each) to take the test traditionally and using the chair test tool, which is one of the most important tools of the Sloodle technology. According to the results, the null hypothesis was rejected, and we accepted the alternative hypothesis that demonstrated a difference in achievement between the two groups.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an abrupt transition from face-to-face learning to online learning, which has also affected the mental health of college students. In this study, we examined the relationship between students’ adjustment to online learning and their mental health by using the Dual-Continua Model. The model assumes that mental disorder and mental well-being are related yet distinct factors of mental health. For this purpose, 2,933 college students completed an online survey around the beginning of the Fall semester of 2020 (
              N
              = 1,724) and the Spring semester of 2021 (
              N
              = 1,209). We assessed participants’ mental well-being, mental disorders, and academic distress by means of the online survey. In addition, we incorporated grades and log data accumulated in the Learning Management System (LMS) as objective learning indicators of academic achievement and engagement in online learning. Results revealed that two dimensions of mental health (i.e., mental well-being and mental disorder) were independently associated with all objective and subjective online learning indicators. Specifically, languishing (i.e., low levels of mental well-being) was negatively associated with student engagement derived from LMS log data and academic achievement and was positively associated with self-reported academic distress even after we controlled for the effects of mental disorder. In addition, mental disorder was negatively related to student engagement and academic achievement and was positively related to academic distress even after we controlled for the effects of mental well-being. These results remained notable even when we controlled for the effects of sociodemographic variables. Our findings imply that applying the Dual-Continua Model contributes to a better understanding of the relationship between college students’ mental health and their adaptation to online learning. We suggest that it is imperative to implement university-wide interventions that promote mental well-being and alleviate psychological symptoms for students’ successful adjustment to online learning.},

	abstract = {The efficacy of mindfulness-based interventions in randomised-controlled trials and large experimental studies has been demonstrated in university student populations. Whilst these investigations have provided insight into the nature of the delivery of mindfulness-based practices, there has been little research in the implementation of self-managed online student wellbeing and mindfulness programs at university. This ecological validation study conducted in 2020 evaluated a real-world implementation of a large, university-wide, online mindfulness-based program that was accessible fully online via the tertiary institutions’ Learning Management System (LMS) student orientation site. The total sample included 833 participants from a range of disciplines and faculties at Monash University, Australia. At the end of the study, 236 (28.3\%) participants were retained and completed the follow-up survey. Participants had the option to engage with the fully self-managed online mindfulness program for a 12-week semester. The mindfulness practices were pre-recorded, audio-guided sessions, and 10–15 min in length. Baseline and end of semester questionnaires included the 14-item Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale, 10-item Perceived Stress Scale and the 18-item Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire. Participants who engaged with the mindfulness program over 3 or more weeks showed significant improvements in all three outcome measures, and all participants showed significant improvements in wellbeing at the end of semester. Learning analytics obtained via the LMS revealed that 58.6\% (
              n
              = 489) had not logged into the mindfulness program at all, almost a third (31.0\%,
              n
              = 259) logged into the program materials once or twice, and 10.2\% (
              n
              = 85) of the whole sample engaged with the program actively, having logged in three or more times. The total number of student logins peaked in week 2, reduced between week 2 and week 7 and thereafter activity remained stable until the end of the semester. We hypothesise that the changes in wellbeing, stress and mindfulness at the end of the semester seen in the low engagement participants may partly be explained by the circumstances of COVID-19 restrictions improving. This study has revealed and discusses the complexities of student behaviour and implications for implementing an online mindfulness program in the real- world setting of a university.},

	abstract = {In recent years, learning materials have gradually been applied to ﬂipped classrooms. Teachers share learning materials, and students can preview the learning materials before class. During class, the teacher can discuss students’ questions from their notes from previewing the learning materials. The social media platform Facebook provides access to learning materials and diversiﬁed interactions, such as sharing knowledge, annotating learning materials, and establishing common objectives. Previous studies have explored the effect of ﬂipped classrooms on students’ learning engagement, attitudes, and performance. In this paper, we apply educational data mining to explore the relationship between students’ viewing behaviors in accessing learning materials and their performance in ﬂipped classrooms. The participants are classiﬁed into an experimental group and a control group to engage in ﬂipped classroom activities. The experimental group uses the social media platform Facebook for ﬂipped learning, and the control group uses a learning management system for ﬂipped learning. The results show that there is a signiﬁcant difference in the learning performance between the two groups, with the average score of the experimental group being higher than that of the control group. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that the viewing behaviors and performance of the students within the experimental group differ signiﬁcantly.},

In this study, we analyse: (1) whether signiﬁcant differences exist between the learning outcomes of students and their learning patterns on the platform, depending on the type of B-Learning [Replacement blend (RB) vs. Supplemental blend (SB)]; (2) whether a relation exists between the metacognitive and the motivational strategies (MS) of students, their learning outcomes and their learning patterns on the platform. The 87,065 log records of 129 students (69 in RB and 60 in SB) in the Moodle 3.1 platform were analyzed. The results revealed different learning patterns between students depending on the type of B-Learning (RB vs. SB). We have found that the degree of blend, RB vs. SB, seems to condition student behavior on the platform. Learning patterns in RB environments can predict student learning outcomes. Additionally, in RB environments there is a relationship between the learning patterns and the metacognitive and (MS) of the students.},

The aim of this study is to determine whether functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) can be used as an additional tool for assessing the learning outcome of virtual reality (VR) based learning modules. The hypothesis is that together with an improvement in learning outcome there would be a decrease in the participants’ cerebral oxygenation levels measured from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) region and an increase of participants’ serious gaming results. To test this hypothesis, the subjects were recruited and divided into four groups with different combinations of prior virtual reality experience and prior Basic Life Support (BLS) knowledge levels. A VR based serious gaming module for teaching BLS and 16-Channel fNIRS system were used to collect data from the participants. Results of the participants’ scores acquired from the serious gaming module were compared with fNIRS measures on the initial and ﬁnal training sessions. Kruskal Wallis test was run to determine any signiﬁcant statistical difference between the groups and Mann–Whitney U test was utilized to obtain pairwise comparisons. BLS training scores of the participants acquired from VR based serious game’s the learning management system and fNIRS measurements revealed decrease in use of resources from the PFC, but increase in behavioral performance. Importantly, brain-based measures can provide an additional quantitative metric for trainee’s expertise development and can assist the medical simulation instructors.},

	abstract = {Introduction
              In the dynamic landscape of education, the fusion of technology and learning, commonly termed “technology-enhanced learning” (TEL), has emerged as a transformative phenomenon. This study focuses on the imperative integration of TEL in medical education, recognizing the diverse digital literacy levels of adult learners. The exploration introduces the innovative E-Portal training program, designed to empower health professions educators with essential skills for proficiently employing digital tools in instruction.
            
            
              Methodology
              A dedicated team of medical educationists conducted a thorough investigation into E-curriculum design and delivery, employing the Moodle Learning Management System as the foundation for the E-Portal training program. The training, spanning crucial stages such as course design, content delivery, self-paced teaching, and quality assessment, facilitated participant progression at individual paces, unlocking subsequent steps upon meeting stipulated prerequisites. A pre-training questionnaire gauged participants’ comprehension of distance learning, e-learning, synchronous and asynchronous teaching, and self-directed study. Subsequent focus group discussion post-training generated rich insights into participants’ experiences, reflections, and identified challenges.
            
            
              Results
              The results illuminate participants’ limited adeptness with e-learning terminology, successful assimilation of components and functionalities, and heightened confidence in online teaching practices. However, discerned challenges during implementation, such as technical hurdles and engagement issues, highlight the multifaceted nature of TEL integration. While the E-Portal training positively impacted preparedness, participant feedback advocates for improvements in assessment tools, technical training provisions, and exploration of alternative Learning Management Systems.
            
            
              Discussion and conclusion
              Study emphasizes the ongoing need for diverse training methodologies across Learning Management Systems, acknowledging the evolving nature of education and technology. This study underscores the transformative role of a tailored E-Portal training program in seamlessly integrating digital tools into medical education. The comprehensive insights provided contribute to a nuanced understanding of the advantages, obstacles, and potential avenues for enhancement in curriculum delivery through technology-enhanced learning, thereby propelling the field forward.},

For this reason, it seems important to plan models and/or strategies to allow the older adult population to acquire and enhance digital competencies more easily. The goal of this research is to show a blended workshop based on a Learning Management System (LMS) as a supporting tool for older adults’ digital literacy. This blended workshop was based on the adoption of an instructional model and on prior experiences of the groups of elderly that participated in the face-to-face workshops. This study involved 98 adults aged 60 and above, 72 Females (68.5 ± 6.9) and 26 Males (73.3 ± 7.4). 61 older adults participated in the face-to-face workshop (FFG) on digital literacy and 37 participated in the blended workshop (BLG). Digital literacy increased at the post-evaluation after the workshops but even more for the BLG. Likewise, in the validation of the blended workshop the results were positive regarding ease of use, perceived usefulness, attitude toward using and intention to use, which showed that older adults believe that it is useful to implement this type of supporting systems for developing their digital competencies. Hence, it is possible to conclude that older adults are capable of learning and acquiring digital literacy skills as long as they are strongly motivated or they know the functional beneﬁts related to ICT.},

Methods: This study utilized course reports of student access from the learning management system for thirty-one sections of eleven different online asynchronous communication courses taught by ten different faculty members over the fall and spring semesters at a large research university in the southwestern United States. A total sample size of 1,201 students were involved in the study.
Results: Profile Analyses indicate clear curvilinear trends for time of day and day of the week in student course access. Repeated Measures ANOVA results indicate those trends vary significantly from a no effect condition, suggesting that students: (a) schedule their course activities around personal schedules, and (b) that time bound synchronous course may not work for them.
Conclusion: Recommendations for class management by instructors relating to student time poverty need regardless of teaching modality, and future directions for research on time poverty in higher education, are provided.},

	abstract = {Background: The use of digital tools and applications in health professions education is increasing exponentially, however this has the potential to increase the digital inequities with the resulting effect of vulnerable groups facing an increased risk of digital exclusion. It is therefore important to approach digitalization with contextual determinants of the intended and unintended impact in mind. We present a perspective paper on digital equity, informed by lessons learnt at the Kenya Medical Training College (KMTC).
Methods: Using a case description methodology, we examined routine educational data collected from faculty at KMTC in November 2022. This included quantitative and qualitative data on access, ownership, utilization, confidence and skills to create, share, and exchange knowledge on the institution’s learning management system. We used these factors as the conceptual framework for understanding how faculty adopt digitalization in health professions education.
Results: 306 faculty responded to the survey (response rate 27.8\%) of whom 90.8 and 75.2\% had personal laptops at home and at work and 75.9\% had internet at work. 53.4\% (n  =  163) knew they had accounts created on the institution’s learning management system (LMS) majority of whom had basic skills and were able to perform skills such as logging in and accessing learning resources. However, a minority had advanced skills needed for teaching and learning in the LMS.
Conclusion: Medical education institutions in LMICs need to adopt programs to enhance digital literacy and monitoring of access, utilization and self-efficacy across all learner and faculty groups, to ensure that digital technologies reduce rather than exacerbate existing inequities.},

	abstract = {Introduction
              As artificial intelligence (AI) technology becomes more widespread in the classroom environment, educators have relied on data-driven machine learning (ML) techniques and statistical frameworks to derive insights into student performance patterns. Bayesian methodologies have emerged as a more intuitive approach to frequentist methods of inference since they link prior assumptions and data together to provide a quantitative distribution of final model parameter estimates. Despite their alignment with four recent ML assessment criteria developed in the educational literature, Bayesian methodologies have received considerably less attention by academic stakeholders prompting the need to empirically discern how these techniques can be used to provide actionable insights into student performance.
            
            
              Methods
              To identify the factors most indicative of student retention and attrition, we apply a Bayesian framework to comparatively examine the differential impact that the amalgamation of traditional and AI-driven predictors has on student performance in an undergraduate in-person science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) course.
            
            
              Results
              Interaction with the course learning management system (LMS) and performance on diagnostic concept inventory (CI) assessments provided the greatest insights into final course performance. Establishing informative prior values using historical classroom data did not always appreciably enhance model fit.
            
            
              Discussion
              We discuss how Bayesian methodologies are a more pragmatic and interpretable way of assessing student performance and are a promising tool for use in science education research and assessment.},

	abstract = {The switch to emergency remote teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic became for many university instructors a necessity to familiarise themselves with the institution’s online learning management system (LMS). This switch to online teaching made learning activities, course design patterns, and pedagogical approaches more visible than during face-to-face teaching. Furthermore, the process of translating physical learning activities to the digital space was challenging and needed institutional and leadership support. This paper presents an analysis of the changes made to the learning designs of 102 courses in a university’s LMS before, during, and after the pandemic. Using descriptive statistics and Epistemic Network Analysis we used LMS data to explore the use of LMS features revealing not only the overall university trends, but also faculty differences. In addition, we compared the learning activities as described in course descriptions with the actual learning activities designed in the LMS. Our findings show that although the switch to emergency remote teaching forced many instructors to change the learning designs of their courses, some instructors reverted to their pre-pandemic learning designs after the pandemic, while other instructors did not change their learning design during the pandemic at all. In addition, we identified a positive trend of an increased use of activity features in the learning management system. Finally, we reflected on the importance of the university leadership supporting the digital transformation.},

	abstract = {Asynchronous online courses are popular because they offer benefits to both students and instructors. Students benefit from the convenience, flexibility, affordability, freedom of geography, and access to information. Instructors and institutions benefit by having a broad geographical reach, scalability, and cost-savings of no physical classroom. A challenge with asynchronous online courses is providing students with engaging, collaborative and interactive experiences. Here, we describe how an online poster symposium can be used as a unique educational experience and assessment tool in a large-enrollment (e.g., 500 students), asynchronous, natural science, general education (GE) course. The course, Introduction to Environmental Science (ENR2100), was delivered using distance education (DE) technology over a 15-week semester. In ENR2100 students learn a variety of topics including freshwater resources, surface water, aquifers, groundwater hydrology, ecohydrology, coastal and ocean circulation, drinking water, water purification, wastewater treatment, irrigation, urban and agricultural runoff, sediment and contaminant transport, water cycle, water policy, water pollution, and water quality. Here we present a is a long-term study that takes place from 2017 to 2022 (before and after COVID-19) and involved 5,625 students over 8 semesters. Scaffolding was used to break up the poster project into smaller, more manageable assignments, which students completed throughout the semester. Instructions, examples, how-to videos, book chapters and rubrics were used to accommodate Students’ different levels of knowledge. Poster assignments were designed to teach students how to find and critically evaluate sources of information, recognize the changing nature of scientific knowledge, methods, models and tools, understand the application of scientific data and technological developments, and evaluate the social and ethical implications of natural science discoveries. At the end of the semester students participated in an asynchronous online poster symposium. Each student delivered a 5-min poster presentation using an online learning management system and completed peer reviews of their classmates’ posters using a rubric. This poster project met the learning objectives of our natural science, general education course and taught students important written, visual and verbal communication skills. Students were surveyed to determine, which parts of the course were most effective for instruction and learning. Students ranked poster assignments first, followed closely by lectures videos. Approximately 87\% of students were confident that they could produce a scientific poster in the future and 80\% of students recommended virtual poster symposiums for online courses.},

	abstract = {The steady increase in use of online educational tools and services has led to a large amount of educational video materials made available for students to watch. Finding the right video content is usually supported by the overarching learning management system and its user interface that organizes various video items by course, categories and weeks, and makes them searchable. However, once a wanted video is found, students are often left without further guidance as to what parts in that video they should focus on. In this article, an additional timeline visualization to augment the conventional playback timeline is introduced which employs a novel playback weighting strategy in which the history of different video interactions generate scores based on the context of each playback. This includes whether the playback started after jumping forward or backward in the video, whether the playback was at a faster or slower speed, and whether the playback window was in focus on the student's screen or was in the background. The resultant scores are presented on the additional timeline, making it in effect a playback-centric usage graph nuanced by how each playback was executed. Students are informed by this visualization on the playback by their peers and can selectively watch those portions which the contour of the usage visualization suggests. The visualization was implemented as a fully-fledged web application and deployed in an undergraduate course at a university for two full semesters. A total of 270 students used the system throughout both semesters watching 52 videos, guided by visualizations on what to watch. Analysis of playback logs revealed that students selectively watched portions in videos corresponding to the most important portions of the videos as assessed by the instructor who created the videos. The characteristics of this method as a way of guiding students as to where to watch as well as a complementary tool for playback analysis, are discussed. Further insights into the potential values of this visualization and its underlying playback weighting strategy are also discussed.},

	abstract = {Math anxiety is a feeling of tension, worry, and/or fear in situations involving math-related activities. The relationship between Math anxiety and math cognition has been frequently studied, and the negative associations between the two have been observed at multiple levels of mathematical processing ranging from simple counting to complex math problems. These negative associations are evident across various developmental stages. The aim of this study is to identify teaching and learning methods in higher education that students high in math anxiety use and beneﬁt from. Through an anonymous online survey, psychology students enrolled in a statistics course rated their Math anxiety, Subjective numeracy, and Objective numeracy; in addition, they rated their success in the statistics course and their general preference for different forms of learning (e.g., face to face learning, online course material, as well as the use of the online video material presented on University of Gothenburg’s learning management system [GUL]). The results gave no support to the notion that students high in Math anxiety used online teaching tools more than other students. However, students high in Math anxiety said they used their classmates as help to pass the course to a greater extent compared to those lower in Math anxiety.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic triggered an unprecedented shift to online learning, significantly impacting the higher education landscape. This paper examines the challenges faced by faculty and students during the rapid transition to online instruction and explores best practices for delivering effective online courses. The increased adoption of online learning created stress for faculty and resulted in academic setbacks for students. Although challenges are present strategies exist to help faculty create rich online learning environments. One important element is engagement, which looks at both student engagement with the material and with their classmates and faculty. In addition to working on student engagement the faculty were now in a position that required a new type of expertise to manage online interactions, which can be much different from their experiences in traditional classrooms. Insufficient time for proper course adaptation and limited knowledge of online teaching methods added to these challenges. Effective online delivery requires careful planning, utilization of advanced instructional technologies, and creating an immersive and interactive learning environment. Faculty must also adapt their teaching strategies to accommodate the unique challenges of online instruction. This review highlights the significance of a quality learning management system (LMS) as the backbone of online courses. An effective LMS facilitates course management, content delivery, and student interaction. Future considerations include providing comprehensive faculty support and training, promoting effective communication and collaboration among students, and incorporating interactive elements into online lessons. The following will provide lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic which will help faculty to improve their instructional competence and social presence in the online classroom.},

	abstract = {The future of university learning in Sub-Saharan Africa has become increasingly digitally transformed by both eLearning, and learning analytics, post-COVID-19 pandemic. Learning analytics intervention is critical for effective support of socially-shared regulated learning skills, which are crucial for twenty-first-century e-Learners. Socially-shared regulation is the major determinant of successful collaborative e-learning. However, most e-learners lack such skills thereby facing sociocognitive challenges, due to the unavailability of intelligent support during learning. This research aims to investigate and understand the effect of Learning Analytics instructional support using feedback and prompts, on e-learners’ SSRL indicators. A theoretical model was derived from these factors and built from selected features. Both survey data and behavioral trace data were employed in the Learning analytics-based intervention. In this paper, only a segment of the data is discussed. The e-learners’ perceptions and feedback confirmed that Learning Analytics-based interventions using prompts and feedback are effective in promoting SSRL in collaborative e-learning contexts. The findings indicated that the success of SSRLA-based intervention be tied to support from instructors and academic counselors, particularly feedback on previous problems and quizzes. This will improve e-learners’ SSRL skills for quality educational experience, hence motivate e-learners, and help lecturers to identify at-risk learners in web programming problem-based courses. In conclusion, without adequate utilization of the Learning Analytics interventional trace data, critical information about learners’ behavior patterns in terms of their online interactivity with the course activities and their SSRL profiles and strategies cannot be disclosed leading to little improvement of e-Learning interventions.},

In the literature, there are some plugins to analyze LMS data, but the issue is that plugins need to be installed by the administrators. This demo presents Statoodle, a simple desktop tool aimed to analyze Moodle data based on exported logs, which can be obtained by any instructor. Among its functionalities, it can inspect activity within the exams to determine whether or not there are unauthorized accesses, which is something that other plugins do not often include, it can provide detailed PDF reports about the overall performance of the quizzes (using algorithms, such as the Item Response Theory to analyze items’ difficulty), Excel reports with indicators about students’ activity and overall statistics about the grades. The tool has been tested in two courses and it has shown potential to detect cheating cases and/or prevent students from cheating when they are alerted that logs will be processed.},

            Prediction of learners’ course performance has been a central theme in learning analytics (LA) since the inception of the field. The main motivation for such predictions has been to identify learners who are at risk of low achievement so that they could be offered timely support based on intervention strategies derived from analysis of learners’ data. To predict student success, numerous indicators, from varying data sources, have been examined and reported in the literature. Likewise, a variety of predictive algorithms have been used. The objective of this chapter is to introduce the reader to predictive modelling in LA, through a review of the main objectives, indicators, and algorithms that have been operationalized in previous works as well as a step-by-step tutorial of how to perform predictive modelling in LA using R. The tutorial demonstrates how to predict student success using learning traces originating from a learning management system, guiding the reader through all the required steps from the data preparation all to the evaluation of the built models.},

	abstract = {In recent years, university teaching methods have evolved and almost all higher education institutions use e-learning platforms to deliver courses and learning activities. However, these digital learning environments present significant dropout and low completion rates. This is primarily due to the lack of student motivation and engagement. Gamification which can be defined as the application of game design elements in non-game activities has been used to address the issue of learner distraction and stimulate students’ involvement in the course. However, choosing the right combination of game elements remains a challenge for gamification designers and practitioners due to the lack of proven design approaches, and there is no one-size-fits-all approach that works regardless of the gamification context. Therefore, our study focused on providing a comprehensive overview of the current state of gamification in online learning in higher education that can serve as a resource for gamification practitioners when designing gamified systems. In this paper, we aimed to systematically explore the different game elements and gamification theory that have been used in empirical studies; establish different ways in which these game elements have been combined and provide a review of the state-of-the-art of approaches proposed in the literature for gamifying e-learning systems in higher education. A systematic search of databases was conducted to select articles related to gamification in digital higher education for this review, namely, Scopus and Google Scholar databases. We included studies that consider the definition of gamification as the application of game design elements in non-game activities, designed for online higher education. We excluded papers that use the term of gamification to refer to game-based learning, serious games, games, video games, and those that consider face-to-face learning environments. We found that PBL elements (points, badges, and leaderboards), levels, and feedback and are the most commonly used elements for gamifying e-learning systems in higher education. We also observed the increasing use of deeper elements like challenges and storytelling. Furthermore, we noticed that of 39 primary studies, only nine studies were underpinned by motivational theories, and only two other studies used theoretical gamification frameworks proposed in the literature to build their e-learning systems. Finally, our classification of gamification approaches reveals the trend towards customization and personalization in gamification and highlights the lack of studies on content gamification compared to structural gamification.},

	abstract = {The sharable e-learning platform can be presented as a useful learning environment for students on the cloud computing infrastructure. Virtual classrooms are momentarily taking the place of conventional ones, which means that e-learning is becoming more popular. There are currently no strategies for estimating how much cloud resources will be used. Because of this, students can access learning objects without deciding to follow a different learning management system (LMS). The proposed deep learning-based e-learning platform (DL-E-LP) can enable separate LMS embedded in multiple e-learning standards to share the learning objects. Using a smart learning system, teachers can keep track of their students’ progress more easily. The convolutional neural network has been used to develop face recognition and monitor students’ knowledge learning level in deep learning. The use of modern technologies and smart classrooms makes learning easier for all students. The proposed paradigm is both efficient and productive through experimentation.},

	abstract = {The problem of internet connectivity in the Philippines has added a heavy burden to the online learning environment and the use of learning management systems by the nursing educational sector. Thus, the researchers developed the Filipinized Learning Management System (FLMS) that addresses the problem of unstable internet connection, is freely accessible, and is responsive to the teaching and learning needs of Filipino nursing faculty and students. Faculty and students were surveyed about their initial experiences and thoughts with the system utilizing a mixed-methods approach, which involved a series of focus group discussions and the use of the Technology-Acceptance Model (TAM) questionnaire. The FLMS’s design features include target user appropriateness, lower and lesser system operating and maintenance requirements, offline features, and multi-modal means of content presentation and communication. Preliminary findings indicate that the Filipinized Learning Management System (FLMS) demonstrated the potential to address connectivity issues, featuring a user-friendly interface and offline capabilities. It facilitated engagement and community building through collaborative tools and discussion boards. However, users also faced notable technical challenges, leading to recommendations for system enhancements. The results of the study prove that developing a learning management system entails a process of assessing and understanding its intended users to maximize its potential effectively. The pilot implementation of the FLMS uncovered vital insights into its ability to mitigate connectivity obstacles and enhance online education in the Philippines. It is challenging yet possible. The study hopes to contribute to the discourse of creating technological advancements in the field of education.},

	abstract = {The pandemic has tested the resilience of organizations and consequently hastened the digital acceleration in many organizations. With the Philippine Council for Agriculture, Forestry and Natural Resources Research and Development (DOST-PCAARRD), an e-learning modality was developed to disseminate relevant technologies that have been generated through its various research and development programs and projects. In developing the e-learning platform, the project adopted the ADDIE model of instructional design. This paper describes the process undertaken as PCAARRD transitioned from traditional classroom, face-to-face courses into an e-learning platform, adopting the ADDIE framework of instructional design and using Moodle as a learning management system. It also outlines the challenges and lessons learned from digitization, as well as recommendations and future directions for the program. Following the PCAARRD experience, the ADDIE model was an effective framework to use in e-learning development, primarily based on formative and summative evaluations. The success of e-learning can be considered a factor of various elements, including the learner, resource persons, the training course content, as well as the social interactions and ease of use of technology. The adoption of e-learning as a human capital investment continues to increase, which merits the evaluation of different organizational e-learning programs to introduce new insights or approaches in the delivery of adult learning for agriculture sector research and development.},

	abstract = {Wireless communication and Deep Learning can enhance the capabilities of an educational information management system by optimizing physical resources, improving student learning outcomes, and reducing costs. However, the current information asymmetry in educational information management makes providing convenient information services for schools challenging. Therefore, this paper proposes an educational information management system (EIMS) that integrates wireless communication and deep learning techniques to optimize physical resources, improve student learning outcomes, and reduce costs. The current information asymmetry in educational information management makes providing convenient information services for schools challenging. The suggested design of the EIMS consists of four components: terminals, subsystems, server and database, and school website. The client/server and the browser/server modes are adopted to cross and utilize them under the work features of educational information management. The functional design of the system consists of a management terminal, a teacher terminal, and login and registration. The management terminal includes seven module functions: personal management function, comprehensive query function, status statistics function, attendance management function, teaching resource management function, and basic data management function. The teacher terminal is mainly divided into two parts, one is to upload the video information of the teaching status of the course, and the other is the docking of the algorithm. The system database design consists of four modules: student status management, training management, degree management, and course selection management. In addition, the designed forms include student information, teacher personal information, class schedule, cultivation plan, and student attendance sheet. The suggested EIMS is experimentally tested and analyzed using MATLAB software to educational information management system under BP neural network. The experimental results show that the BP neural network has good applicability to the educational information management system and can accurately predict the trend of educational information management, providing a reference for further improvement.},

	abstract = {Twenty-six students from a sixth grade math class in Upstate New York received guardian approval to participate in a study that gathered data pertaining to student navigation ability, information retrieval ability, and satisfaction in regards to the Learning Management System (LMS) their school utilized. Data collection began with the researchers attending math classes for observation and to conduct cognitive walkthroughs with the students to gather information about their experiences and navigation through the LMS. An eye tracker and the associated eye tracking software were utilized to monitor and detect patterns of eye movements when the students were looking at a device screen. For this study, students were monitored by the eye tracker while they attempted to complete several tasks from the experiment. By measuring the length of time taken by students as they completed tasks on the LMS, quantitative data can be collected and used later in the experiment. After analyzing the time metrics and the eye tracking data produced and feedback given on the questionnaire distributed at the beginning of the experiment, a targeted LMS page was slightly modified in hopes to increase the effectiveness of the page, based on user interface design standards. Well defined organization, accessibility, and usability in an LMS is essential to allow learners to focus to be on their curriculums, and not how to access their assignments. An in-depth analysis of navigation through an LMS will allow for a better understanding of how users interact with the structure of their curriculum in an electronic format. The study described in this paper intended to address the question of whether an LMS used in an elementary school setting can provide users with an interface that optimizes the accessibility and usability of their class materials.},

	abstract = {Learning Management System is a vital organ of any university that exists in today’s digital era. Whilst these platforms are meant to promote quality teaching, learning and assessment, developers and designers often ignore learner’s visual behavior when implementing or maintaining these applications. Consequently, most of these applications appear as poorly designed and populated by disorganized content— eventually provoking tedious navigations and interactions at the learner’s end. Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University uses Learning Mall to organize coursework, assessment and facilitate staff-student interactions. However, there is an absence of evidence whether any usability study on the Learning Mall, vis-à-vis learners’ gaze behavior and visual attention, has ever been carried out at the University. This paper reports an ongoing study which is at the very preliminary stage, and linked with Eye-tracking, Participatory Design and Mixed Methods approaches to bring learner-centered improvements in the Learning Mall.},

Using a quantitative approach and a comprehensive questionnaire based on recent work by the Australasian Council on Open, Distance, and e-Learning (as reported by ACODE, Survey of micro-credentialing practice in Australasian universities 2021: An ACODE Whitepaper—October 2021, 2021), the study investigates areas such as standards, policies, adoption rates, integration into the curriculum, credentialing engines, and professional development. The findings indicate that micro-credentialing is still in its early stages in the region, with most universities initiating micro-credentialing within the past four years. The lack of a favorable policy ecosystem and standards for learning design, content, delivery, assessment, sizing, and issuance are identified as significant hindrances to the adoption of micro-credentials. To advance the micro-credential market, the study recommends that stakeholders collaborate and create quality standards, accountability mechanisms, financing strategies, and documentation frameworks that promote interoperability. The study suggests that improving policies for micro-credentials could help legitimize them and promote a more unified vision of microcredentials as a crucial component of the national educational strategy.},

	abstract = {This meta-analysis (25 articles, k = 44 independent data sources, N = 2,323) examines the effectiveness of flipped classroom on student achievement in secondary education. The flipped classroom model refers to an instructional approach in which students watch educational videos at home and homework assignments are done in class. Effect sizes were calculated for the research designs “post-test only”, “pre-test-post-test (time)” and “pre-test-post-test with control group (treatment)”. The meta-analytical findings for the condition “treatment” confirm the effectiveness of flipped classroom on student achievement in comparison to traditional instruction (Cohen's d = 0.42, 95 \% CI [0.20 – 0.63], Z = 3.81, p {\textless} .001). Moderator analyses on the effect sizes “time” show stronger effects for subjects in the STEM area (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) than for foreign languages and humanities. The effect sizes were also higher for shorter intervention studies than for longer ones and if quiz at home had been left out. Moderator analyses on the effect sizes “post-test only” and “treatment” make clear that the effect sizes for intervention studies without a learning management system are higher than with a learning management system. Findings are discussed in terms of their implications for educational practice.},

It promotes collaborative efforts among students, staff, and community members to address specific local challenges effectively. By actively engaging with these communities, participants gain profound insights into the social, cultural, economic, and environmental factors shaping them, enabling them to apply their disciplinary knowledge aptly to address community issues. Extended on-site durations further amplify the benefits, offering a deeper understanding of community needs, values, and perspectives. This fosters enduring collaborations and promotes social, economic, and environmental sustainability. Experiential learning activities during the experimental week, such as service-learning projects and community-based research, enhance critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication skills, while heightening awareness of social and cultural dynamics within the community. In conclusion, community-based learning proves invaluable in urban design and planning studios, fostering sustained collaboration and promoting holistic sustainability.},

The sample incorporated responses from educators, students and technical personnel from 146 tertiary education institutions. We aimed to identify the institutional, learning- and teaching-related, and personal components that differed in countries signiﬁcantly, as well as the components that contributed to these differences. The discriminant analysis was used. The ﬁndings revealed that all countries are still on the low capacity level for integrating disruptive technologies to e-learning on a large scale. Infrastructural capacity in the countries did not differ signiﬁcantly, but institutional norms and regulations, practices for teaching, and in attitudes and values diverged the countries. These critical elements may be used to develop the capacities in institutions to support the disruptive technology uptake.},

As a result, (prospective) teachers are required to take a closer look at AI and its application for teaching and learning processes. This article focuses on the potential of AI to assist teachers in designing lessons based on the fundamentals and functions of AI. We explore the question of how an AI-based learning platform can be designed to help develop lesson planning skills. The AI platform EDDA will be presented, which can be used to analyze lesson plans and materials during studies, in the preparatory service and in teaching practice. EDDA provides feedback on the implementation of selected didactic criteria of lesson planning and provides information for reflection and further development of lesson plans. EDDA also provides an infrastructure for further research into teaching and learning with AI.

	abstract = {Introduction  In response to the COVID-19 crisis, this study aimed to introduce a new virtual teaching model for anatomy education that combines Peer-Assisted Learning (PAL) and flipped classrooms, aligning with constructivist principles.
Method  The Flipped Peer Assisted (FPA) method was implemented in a virtual neuroanatomy course for second-year medical students at Birjand University of Medical Sciences via a descriptive study. The method involved small groups of PAL, with peer learning serving as educational assistants and the teacher acting as a facilitator. Educational content was uploaded to the university’s learning management system (LMS). The opinion of medical students regarding the teaching method were evaluated using a 15-item questionnaire on a five-point Likert scale.
Results  A total of 210 students participated in the instruction using the FPA method. The analysis of students’ scores revealed an average score of 26.75 ± 3.67 on the 30-point test. According to student feedback, this teaching method effectively motivated students to study, enhanced teamwork and communication skills, transformed their perspective on the anatomy course, provided opportunities for formative assessment and feedback, and demonstrated the teacher’s dedication to education.
Conclusion  The FPA model demonstrates its effectiveness in transforming traditional classroom teaching and fostering teaching and learning in virtual environments, particularly during pandemics like COVID-19. This model holds promise for enhancing anatomy education in challenging circumstances.},

It employed tests and semi-structured interviews to investigate whether differences exist between Collaborative Digital Learning (CDL) and Individual Digital Learning (IDL) regarding participants’ reading comprehension and vocabulary learning and to explore EFL learners’ perceptions of CDL. Sixty EFL majors enrolled in two sections of the same course- RC and VL- were randomly assigned to a treatment group and a control group. Both groups were pre-tested before performing the assigned digital activities through the learning management platform and Quizlet website. At the end of the course, both groups were post-tested. The treatment group was only individually interviewed about CDL's impact and perceptions. The results revealed that CDL had improved students' RC and VL. The treatment group outperformed the control group in the post-test scores in the test dimensions, RC and VL, and in the overall scores of the test. The analyses, including paired-sample t-tests, independent-sample t-tests, Cohen'd statistics, and qualitative content analysis, indicated more significant benefits of CDL over IDL in improving RC and VL. It emphasized the importance of integrating collaboration activities in reading and VL classes. The data obtained from the interviews showed the learners' preference for CDL as a valuable interactional setting for English as a foreign language. This study highlights the need for collaboration and more digital tools to be integrated into EFL education in Saudi Arabia.

For this purpose, data available in the Web of Science database were examined using bibliometric analysis. The publication distribution varied between 2011 and 2022, with the number of publications reaching its peak in 2020 and declining thereafter. Findings from co-authorship analysis indicate that Dragan Gašević is the most prolific author and the most cited researcher in the field of learning analytics. Results of co-authorship analysis by country suggest that researchers affiliated with institutions in Australia engage in more collaborative work and cooperation. Results of co-authorship analysis by organizations demonstrate that Monash University in Australia is the organization with the highest level of collaboration with other organizations. The most cited work is Ferguson's (2012) article titled "Learning analytics: drivers, developments and challenges." The most frequently used keywords in conjunction with learning analytics are higher education, educational data mining, online learning, learning design, and self-regulated learning. In recent years, there has been a focus on learning analytics related to learning management systems (LMS) rather than MOOCs in learning environments. The British Journal of Educational Technology, which was established in 1970, is the most cited journal that is commonly referenced in the articles. It is hoped that this study will serve as a valuable reference for researchers interested in the field and guide them in making accurate inferences based on a broad perspective.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine if e-learning interventions are efﬁcient to review Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) and to prevent performance deterioration in neonatal resuscitation of already-certiﬁed healthcare professionals. STUDY DESIGN: In this scoping review, we searched for manuscripts published until June 2020 in ﬁve databases. We included all studies on e-learning use for NRP review in already-certiﬁed healthcare providers.
RESULTS: Among 593 abstracts retrieved, 38 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. Five studies were included. Four studies evaluated the effectiveness of e-learning interventions immediately or months after their completion by providers. These interventions did not consistently enhance their NRP knowledge and their performance. One study showed that a growth mindset can inﬂuence positively neonatal resuscitation performance after an e-learning simulation.
CONCLUSION: There is not enough evidence to conclude that e-learning interventions can prevent neonatal resuscitation knowledge and performance decay in already-certiﬁed providers. More research is needed on the use of e-learning simulationbased scenarios to improve NRP retention.

	abstract = {Gamification is the use of game elements in a non-game context to encourage desired behaviours. It has been identified as a promising strategy for improving user motivation on e-learning platforms. Since previous literature reviews and meta-analyses only considered gamification and learning efforts without focusing directly on the gamification elements and their impact, a research gap was identified. Based on the studies analysed, the most commonly used gamification elements in the literature were identified and examined to determine whether there are any significant results in terms of motivational changes. Three areas of research questions were formulated for this meta-analysis: Which gamification elements should be used to increase learning motivation in asynchronous e-learning? Which success factors should be considered to increase the motivation of the learners when using gamification elements? Is there a specific selection of gamification elements that significantly increase motivation in asynchronous e-learning? The literature search process followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) methodology. Afterward, the studies were examined to determine their relevance based on defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The next step was title and abstract screening, followed by a full-text screening. A complementary search of the included literature was then conducted using snowballing techniques. Finally, the most relevant literature was reviewed using quality assessment criteria. Our analysis concluded that the most promising gamification elements are badges, leaderboards, level up systems and progress bars. The combination of elements increases users’ motivation significantly, especially the combination of badges with leaderboards or level up systems. These insights can contribute to the design of e-learning platforms and online courses.},

	abstract = {In recent times, technology has played a significant role in education, with artificial intelligence (AI), one of these technological tools, becoming an emerging topic in education. It has been of great concern to professionals and researchers in the fields of science and education. The growing and/or increasing power of this app in society and in the education sector, especially as it affects the teaching profession, or teachers, to be specific, is of great worry and/or a profound risk. Education has been the basis for all progressive nations, and teachers have also been the main part of this progress, as they remain at the helm of major instructional decisions and the management of any of these innovative ideas to improve the teaching-learning process. With advances in technology and constant technological innovations, teachers are constantly refusing to adopt or integrate any of these innovative technologies or ideas in the education system. Artificial intelligence has become one of these innovative ideas, and is currently an emerging topic in the education system in recent years, threatening the foundations of teachers or educators in recent times. This paper focused on the argument that teaching machines will or will not replace human teachers in the classroom. Therefore, the researchers hope to find out from the existing literature if artificial intelligence could, in reality, replace the job of teachers in the classroom or act as an enhancer for teachers in the entire education sector. The paper further discussed the merits of AI in the modern classroom. The need for IT literacy among teachers and students alike in contemporary education structures was also discussed. The paper finally looked into the teachers’ challenges against successful implementation of artificial intelligence teaching machines in the education process and made recommendations and suggestions for sequential improvements.},

	abstract = {Learning analytics leverages the use of technology to gather and analyse data about student performance, engagement, and learning behaviours, which can help educators make informed decisions about how to improve learning outcomes. In higher education, learning analytics can provide insights into student engagement, performance, and learning pathways. Collaborative learning in higher education involves a group of students working together towards a common goal or task. Collaborative learning encourages students to work together to solve problems, analyse information, and make decisions, especially in self-directed learning environment. Through discussion and debate, students develop critical thinking skills and learn to approach problems from different perspectives to enhance problem-solving skills. Collaborative learning provides opportunities for students to work with others from diverse backgrounds, helping them develop interpersonal skills such as communication, teamwork, and leadership. While collaborative learning helps students to foster critical thinking and develop interpersonal skills, students’ activities and engagement in collaborative learning are not properly assessed and measured. Student performance indicators are highly dependent on the learning activities and resources used in the learning management system based on individual basis. The ability and potential of learning analytics to track students’ behaviour and performance in team, and to monitor the effectiveness of their sharing and communication is not fully utilised in higher education. This paper addresses this issue and aims to provide an overview of collaborative learning analytics. The overview elaborates essential elements in collaborative learning and defines features in analytics to support collaborative learning. The overview is expected to guide to educators and developers in promoting and assessing students’ performance based on collaborative works.},

However, despite the growing interest and potential benefits of flipped learning, several challenges and areas of concern persist. This systematic literature review critically examines the implementation of the flipped classroom in higher education by focusing on the role of technologies and tools, pedagogical activities and courses, and existing challenges. Using a systematic approach, a total of 30 research articles published between 2014 and 2023 were chosen for the review. This study identified video creation tools, learning management systems (LMS), content repositories, collaborative platforms, podcasts, and online assessment tools as technologies that play a central role in the flipped classroom. Moreover, this study identifies specific pedagogical activities within different courses that contribute to the effectiveness of flipped learning in higher education. The implementation challenges that teachers and students may face in the flipped classroom were presented, and potential strategies to alleviate these challenges were provided. This study will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of flipped learning’s benefits, technologies and tools, challenges, and potential to improve higher education.},

	abstract = {Aviation research on artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) has seen signiﬁcant growth as these emerging technologies hold immense potential for supporting both human-centered and technology-centered aspects of civil aircraft operations. This systematic review, following the guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020, was registered on the Open Science Framework (DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/ZR7A3) and focused speciﬁcally on the use of AI, ML, and DL in human-centric ﬂight operations. The review conducted a comprehensive search of databases including Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, as well as online repositories (ResearchGate and Aerospace Research Central) to identify relevant articles published between 2013 and 2023. In total, 32 studies were included, which explored various applications of AI, ML, and DL in aircraft pilots and ﬂight operations. The studies were categorized into four main areas: (i) assessment and management of human factors risks, including AI-assisted data analysis of pilot performance, crew resource management, and ML-based support for pilots’ cognitive workload monitoring, (ii) detection of human errors, with support systems based on ML-based approaches for real-time monitoring and DL models for biometric monitoring of cockpit pilots were identiﬁed for the detection of human errors in ﬂight safety, (iii) reduction and prediction of human errors, categorized into AI-assisted predictive analytics in ﬂight accidents, and ML-based pattern recognition to predict unstable approaches, and (iv) prevention of human errors in aviation through ML utilization for pilot training enhancement, and AI-supporting ﬂight automation and decision support systems for ﬂight operation. Analysis of the included studies revealed a rising trend in the publication of articles after 2020, albeit at a slow rate. It is worth noting that the majority of studies focused on conceptual applications, with fewer studies involving empirical testing. The ﬁndings of this review highlight the potential for future research in developing and testing improved human factors risk assessment (HRA) models assisted by computational intelligence in piloted aircraft operations, with the ultimate aim of enhancing ﬂight safety.},

This digital landscape generates a vast repository of educational data, offering valuable insights for educational stakeholders. However, evaluating student engagement in online learning presents a critical challenge. This study addresses this challenge by focusing on the evaluation of student engagement using Learning Analytics (LA). We introduce DDS-Eng, a Data-Driven Decision Support System designed to analyze students’ engagement. Our approach involves thorough requirement analysis to define decision-makers’ needs and selected data sources, followed by the development of a multidimensional model capturing engagement aspects and associated metrics. We then implement a dedicated interface utilizing Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) queries and a Learning Analytics Dashboard (LAD) to analyze individual student behavior and overall student engagement comprehensively. Finally, we present an empirical evaluation of our LAD conducted in a controlled environment. This research underscores the importance of student engagement in online learning and emphasizes the need for innovative approaches to evaluate learner engagement in multimodal and informal learning environments.},

The current digital transformation of the functioning of society opens up broad opportunities in this direction. The article deals with issues: The new concept of a presystem is introduced. As a practice application of this notion chaotic presystem models are considered, for example, such as Chaotic logic. The expressive possibilities of chaotic logic are considered. The notion of a quasi—fractal chaotic logic to show the impossibility of controlling chaos from the standpoint of quasi-fractal logic due to the presence of holes in chaotic logic from the standpoint of non—deterministic chaos. To investigate presystem conditional groups’ probability function and conditional digitalization function are introduced. Conditional groups’ function of digitalization can be used to clarify the qualitative side of the forecast and its connection with the quantitative characteristics. The deﬁnition of a measurement error, connected with conditional digitalization function is given. As a practice application of this notion the explanation of possible causes of forecasting errors in smart systems/in smart university ranking systems, in ﬁnancial—economic systems can be got. Also, the following results are presented: The existence an element in a chaotic closed associative presystem at which any connections are impossible to set.

The main objective is to monitor and explore how the new concept was developed and implemented within the Czech educational system through the lens of Czech teachers. The process started in the two-year transition period, which was monitored in three rounds: at the beginning (Round 1, autumn 2021), in the middle (Round 2, autumn 2022), and at the end (Round 3, summer 2022). In total, data were collected from Czech primary school teachers of Informatics (N = 229) using a questionnaire. Nine research questions were set that focused on the preference for the new concept, evaluation of respondents’ subject knowledge and didactic skills, consideration of the school equipment, use of new learning materials and teaching methods, main sources of new information in Informatics and teaching Informatics, perceiving the new concept of the Informatics curriculum, in particular, what they consider positive, negative, and what topic/s they miss in the learning content. The results showed that the teachers were not sure of their opinions during and after the transition period, they needed more experience. Therefore, further investigation needs to be conducted that can be carried out continuously every year after the implementation of the new concept, without geographical limits, so that the results could be generalized to the whole population of the country.},

The goal of the XR tools is to trigger an empathetic presence and foster logical reasoning and analytical skills. The XR sessions are supplemented with traditional lectures, peer-to-peer discussions, and a debrieﬁng session. A pilot study in 2022 captured data from a wide range of sources, including self-reporting surveys, physiological data, and visual observations. This article leans on data captured during observation notes and focus group discussions in the aftermath of the study that were videotaped and analyzed thematically. The qualitative pilot study aims to discover if the overarching educational design enhances student engagement with the topic of protection of civilians and offers an alternative approach to teaching it by provoking empathy in XR.},

	abstract = {In today’s technology-driven world, educators need to understand how students use Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) for educational purposes if they wish to effectively design curricula. Today, students seamlessly navigate various devices, creating complex, nontraditional learning environments from a young age. This means educators must recognize the positive affordances of technology while being cautious of negative aspects. Personalized learning opportunities can be developed by understanding students’ digital learning environments or digital eco-systems through learning analytics. This research aims to map students’ digital eco-system usage patterns to inform course design that aligns with student learning expectations as they relate to learning technology. To contextualize technologies and learning environments, a clear understanding of learners’ technological adoption and use in speciﬁc learning contexts is necessary. Artiﬁcial Intelligence techniques can be employed to better understand participants’ technological adoption and use in collaborative educational activities. In this study, participant activity was captured in log data, and Kernel-Based Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) was applied over one academic year. Key ﬁndings include a consistent decrease in online activity throughout the academic year and students favoring mobile and non-mobile devices at different times during activities, suggesting they selectively utilize different affordances based on context and purpose. If this is the case, it would be an insight into how they are shifting between device types depending on the context and purpose. These ﬁndings provide a clearer understanding of how the students behave within a digital eco-system of interconnected devices that function to support their learning. The results and implications for education were discussed, along with suggestions for future research.},

	abstract = {Background  The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel e-learning module in teaching the physical exam of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) in Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA.).
Methods  An e-learning module was developed to convey the TMJ physical examination maneuvers that are considered to be best practice in JIA. Pediatric rheumatology fellows were randomized to two groups. One group received an article describing the physical examination skills while the second group received both the article and module. All participants completed a written pre-test, an in-person objective structured clinical examination (OSCE), a written post-test, and a follow-up survey.
Results  Twenty-two pediatric rheumatology fellows enrolled, with 11 per group. Written test: The two groups improved equally, although there was a trend toward improved defining of maximal incisal opening (MIO) in the module group. OSCE: The mean OSCE score was 11.1 (SD 3.3) in the article group and 13.5 (SD 1.9) in the module group (p = 0.06); significant differences were seen in measuring MIO (p = 0.01), calculating maximal unassisted mouth opening (MUMO; p = 0.01), and assessment of facial symmetry (p = 0.03), all favoring the module. Enjoyment scores in the module group were higher than in the article group (mean 7.7/10 vs. 5.9/10, p = 0.02). The two groups self-reported performing TMJ examinations at comparable rates three months following the intervention.
Conclusions  The study demonstrated that a formalized educational program improved knowledge of the physical exam of the TMJ in JIA. Learners viewing the module were more adept at obtaining quantitative TMJ measurements.},

	abstract = {Wildland research, management, and policy in western democracies have long relied on concepts of equilibrium: succession, sustained yield, stable age or species compositions, fire return intervals, and historical range of variability critically depend on equilibrium assumptions. Not surprisingly, these largely static concepts form the basis for societal expectations, dominant management paradigms, and environmental legislation. Knowledge generation has also assumed high levels of stasis, concentrating on correlational patterns with the expectation that these patterns would be reliably transferrable. Changes in climate, the introduction of large numbers of exotic organisms, and anthropogenic land conversion are leading to unprecedented changes in disturbance regimes and landscape composition. Importantly, these changes are largely non-reversable; once introduced exotic species are seldom eradicated, climates will continue to warm for the foreseeable future, and many types of land conversion cannot be easily undone. Due to their effects on extant infrastructure and expectations for ecosystem services, these changes are, and will be, viewed by western societies as overwhelmingly negative. The continued acceleration of change will generate increasingly novel systems for which the transferability of correlational relationships will prove unreliable. Our abilities to predict system trajectories will therefore necessarily decrease. In this environment, top-down, expert dominated approaches to environmental decision making are unlikely to produce results that meet broader societal expectations. To be successful we need to embrace a more inclusive paradigm of collaborative governance and multiple forms of knowledge for adapting to constant change, including indigenous epistemological systems. By increasing public and stakeholder participation, we can encourage collaborative social learning allowing all parties to more fully understand the complexities and tradeoffs associated with wildland management and the technical limits of models that seek to quantify those tradeoffs. System novelty will necessarily make forecasting more dependent on predictive modeling and will require better models. Data collection should therefore be strongly influenced by model input requirements and validation; research will need to focus on fundamental and causal relationships to a much greater degree than is done currently.},

	abstract = {The Pygmalion effect, which is the influence of teachers’ competence expectations of learners, has been widely studied, but not learners’ competence expectations of teachers. High learner expectations of teachers’ competence seem to have a positive effect on learners themselves, e.g., on motivation and performance. Little is known about the effects of learners’ expectation on teachers’ experience and behavior. In this field study, the relationship between university students’ initial competence expectations of lecturers on their experience during and evaluation of a course session was explored for both students (N = 871 responses; multiple participations possible) and lecturers (N = 41). Multilevel analyses (controlling for students’ initial warmth and attractiveness perceptions of lecturers) showed that students’ competence expectations of their lecturers were positively related to their motivation (interest and boredom) and negatively related to their perceptions of disruptions. The relationship between students’ competence expectations and lecturers’ experience was more unsystematic: positive correlations were found with the rating of the lecturers’ own positive emotions and their feelings of competence, and a negative correlation was found with their disruption mismanagement. In summary, students’ expectations of lecturers seem to be relevant in a teaching-learning context, even though mostly small effect sizes could be shown.},

This scoping review aims to analyze the key features, methodologies, and outcomes of research regarding online assessment accommodations for students with disabilities and extract the best recommendations for curricular design in higher education. Exploring Google Scholar, Taylor and Francis, and Web of Science (WoS) databases, a systematic literature search identiﬁed 26 pertinent studies published since 2019. Thematic analysis revealed four main themes: conceptual developments, barriers to online assessment, recommendations for enhanced accessibility, and accessible curriculum design. The ﬁndings indicate that online assessment is increasingly being viewed as a universal assessment approach with accommodations designed to beneﬁt all students. Higher education institutions should promote uniform accommodations by fostering collaboration between support services and instructors for consistent application across all courses. These accommodations could include strategies like enhancing the accessibility of learning management systems through collaboration, designing courses with progress evaluations and constructive feedback, and allowing task revisions until mastery. Additionally, advocating for various assessment formats, including blackboard quizzes, self-marking tests, and multimedia presentations with ﬂexible completion timelines, aims to boost inclusivity. The insights from this review have the potential to drive positive changes in curriculum design, promoting inclusive education for all students in higher education settings.},

	abstract = {To navigate the dynamic modern education system, teachers need not only subjectspecific competencies but also cross-disciplinary skills, including important socioemotional abilities such as resilience. Resilience can be understood as a crucial capability for adaptability in the teaching profession. Resilient teachers are better able to overcome adverse situations and adapt to changes. They are also less likely to leave the profession. Although the importance of teacher resilience is widely recognized, there is little knowledge about effective strategies to promote this ability. Digital learning environments designed according to media pedagogical and media didactic principles offer promising approaches here, as they create flexible, personalized, and interactive learning opportunities that allow teachers to test and reflect on resilience strategies in a protected space. The project «Fostering Resilience in Teacher Education (FoResT)», a collaboration between the University of Bern and the Bern University of Teacher Education, addresses this research gap by developing a media-didactically designed online learning platform for teaching resilience strategies.},

However, creating, planning, and managing such projects can be challenging. This paper introduces a unique approach to managing consulting projects: Agile Project Management with Scrum. By incorporating a commitment to iteration and communication as the core of the project experience, Agile with Scrum fosters an impactful, realistic, and engaging student consulting experience. This approach enhances decision making, presentations, and team dynamics. This article discusses how one supply chain management course embedded Agile with Scrum into a client consulting project to convert a mediocre experiential learning opportunity into a transformative one. After describing Agile with Scrum and explaining its potential in the classroom, this paper discusses the consulting project before and after Agile; the results; the lessons learned; and the value created for students, clients, and faculty.},

	abstract = {In the era of innovative societal development, virtual reality technologies are becoming an integral tool in the educational process. This article aims to analyse the potential of immersive technologies in implementing virtual learning environments in educational institutions in Ukraine. It has been found that immersive technologies are rapidly evolving from being an innovation to a practical and widely used range of tools. The study established that their implementation into the educational policy paradigm is seen as a promising necessity and a factor in intensifying the quality of education. The essence of the phenomenon of immersive technologies has been specified, with their components distinguished, including objective reality, virtual reality, and augmented reality. The specifics of involving immersive technologies in the educational process in Ukrainian educational institutions have been highlighted. An experiment was conducted involving virtual reality technologies in the professional educational environment of future fire safety specialists through the VR programme FLAIM Systems. During the study of the peculiarities of virtual reality technologies in educational modelling, the priority advantages and associated risks of their integration were highlighted. It was found that the potential of immersive technologies stimulates the optimisation of understanding complex concepts and significantly expands the toolkit of future industry specialists. It was determined that engaging visualisations and the experience of using virtual reality technologies offer an intuitive approach to rather abstract concepts that are difficult to reproduce within the framework of classical pedagogical technologies. It has been substantiated that using virtual reality technologies in the educational and management process has significant advantages over the traditional methodology of educational processes, as it actively engages the sensory system and emotional sphere. It has been proven that virtual reality (VR programmes) has significant potential to positively impact the quality of education in educational institutions in Ukraine.},

	abstract = {In digitalized learning processes, learning analytics (LA) can help teachers make pedagogically sound decisions and support pupils’ self-regulated learning (SRL). However, research on the role of the pedagogical dimensions of learning design (LD) in influencing the possibilities of LA remains scarce. Primary school presents a unique LA context characterized by blended learning environments and pupils’ various abilities to regulate their learning, underscoring teachers’ vital importance. This study explores how pedagogically diverse LDs influence pupils’ SRL behaviors and learning management system (LMS) usage, as well as how this is reflected in LA visualizations. Two LDs were designed and implemented in two primary school classes of fifth (n = 30) and sixth (n = 22) graders within authentic pedagogical and technological contexts. We used sequence analysis to examine the pupils’ SRL actions during LDs, using LMS log data and observation data to contextualize these actions. The results show that LA offers less accurate feedback in more open, collaborative LDs as pupils tend to rely less on the LMS to regulate their learning. Furthermore, the teacher powerfully influences LMS usage in blended primary school classrooms. To maximize the potential of using LA to support SRL, its design needs to be grounded in the LD through an understanding of how the regulation of learning is promoted in diverse learning processes.},

	abstract = {Zusammenfassung
            Die Hochschullehre befindet sich in einem Transformationsprozess, in dem Erkenntnisse aus der Online-Lehre der Pandemiezeit mit der etablierten Präsenzlehre verbunden werden. Im Projekt INKULT an der Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg wurden Flipped Classroom (FC)-Modelle für 13 Lehrveranstaltungen aus unterschiedlichen Fachkulturen entwickelt. Der Fokus lag darauf, FC-Modelle zu erstellen, die den besonderen Bedürfnissen verschiedener Fachrichtungen gerecht werden und die Wahrnehmung des FC-Konzepts durch Lehrende und Studierende zu analysieren. Die Untersuchung brachte zentrale Erfolgsfaktoren und Herausforderungen zum Vorschein und unterstrich die Wichtigkeit einer sorgfältigen Veranstaltungsplanung und der Interaktion mit den Studierenden für den Erfolg des FC. Dabei wird betont, dass eine Reflexion über die veränderte Rolle der Lehrenden und die Förderung des selbstgesteuerten Lernens der Studierenden essentiell für den Erfolg des Formates sind. Weiterbildungsmaßnahmen für Lehrende und die Entwicklung metakognitiver Kompetenzen bei Studierenden sind dabei von zentraler Bedeutung. Die Resultate unterstreichen zudem die wesentliche Bedeutung von Ressourcen, sowohl finanzieller als auch personeller Art, für die Implementierung des FC-Ansatzes. Die Implementierung des FC-Konzepts erfordert also eine ganzheitliche Herangehensweise, die organisatorische, didaktische und individuelle Aspekte gleichermaßen berücksichtigt und unterstützt. Durch kontinuierliche Reflexion, kritische Evaluation und iterative Anpassung kann ein Mehrwert durch FC-Modelle für die Lehre generiert werde.},

	abstract = {Critical research on data visualisations in education has so far mostly focused on the representation of numeric data in dashboards or graphs. Consequently, the question of how schools are made visible and (re)enacted through visual structures on data-mediated interfaces more broadly – what we call Graphic Data Visualisations (GDV) – has remained under-researched. Addressing that research gap, this study specifically scrutinises the role of GDV as non-human actors within the design process of a Moodle-based learning management system (LMS) in four schools. Following a critical co-design approach, the potential of GDV to reflect on how the visual design shapes educational practices, and to adapt it according to pedagogical and organisational needs is explored. Focusing on ‘critical incidents’ in the design process, we found that local practices substantially influenced the data-based, visual enactment of a school through specific GDV. At the same time, the use of certain GDV enhanced a general critical engagement with datafication among school actors.},

	abstract = {Student involvement in the learning process is crucial as it affects their learning success. The implementation of online learning at UNISA Yogyakarta faced obstacles due to low student participation. Student interest in accessing the LMS is influenced by the quality of the LMS. The results of LMS monitoring and evaluation over the past year showed an average score of 2.28 (categorized as sufficient). Courses with good LMS evaluation scores accounted for 23.6\%. The development of the LMS is an effort to increase student involvement in cognitive, behavioral, emotional, and performance aspects. This research is a collaborative study on LMS development in partnership with Universiti Malaysia Pahang. The development method uses the 4D model (Define, Design, Develop, Disseminate). The measurement of learning engagement, as the impact of CLMS development, was conducted using the Online Student Engagement Scale (OSE) adapted from Dixson (2015). Data analysis employed qualitative analysis and statistical frequency distribution for each engagement component. The results showed that the average engagement of respondents at UNISA Yogyakarta before CLMS development was 74.7, and the post-test average was 78.8, indicating a score increase of 5\% (4.1). Meanwhile, the average engagement score of respondents at UMP was 73.4. The effectiveness test resulted in a p-value of 0.002 (p{\textless}0.05), indicating that CLMS development is effective in improving student learning engagement. Each course is expected to develop innovative teaching media within the LMS to enhance the student learning process.},

This article deals with the possibilities of using adaptive tools that are offered by learning management system (LMS) Moodle when creating a personalised e-course. The methodology created by the authors of the article for personalised e-course adjusts the study content based on characteristics of each student stated by his or her initial knowledge, learning style, and motivation. The article is aimed at the presentation of the created methodology and its impact on the level of student’s output knowledge as well as overall learning efficiency. By using the methodology, there was an opportunity to compare the impact of two different approaches – the personalised one and non-personalised. Statistical analysis revealed that the use of personalized e-course has a positive impact on students’ activity, motivation, and their level of output knowledge. The results showed that the attended secondary school has no or only minimal impact on the output knowledge if the students studied through the personalized e-course. An interesting finding was that students in all surveys have a stronger tendency to prefer the same learning styles over the years.},

	abstract = {The cognitive aspect is crucial in developing interactive and adaptive systems, including learning management systems (LMS). By understanding human cognitive processes, developers can create adaptive systems that are sustainably used by targeted users. Cognitive traits need to be explored to become part of the user model, especially especially to develop an LMS with an adaptive interface based on cognitive load. However, there is limited research exploring the correlation between cognitive load and adaptive interfaces, as well as the visualization of information, within online learning settings, including those specifically within LMS platforms. Additionally, a lack of understanding of cognitive processes renders the use of LMS static and unable to adapt to learners’ abilities. Therefore, information regarding the specific characteristics or model of cognitive load that accurately represent LMS users as triggers for adaptive interfaces needs to be further examined. A total of four experts in the cognitive field were interviewed. The interview process was conducted in a semi-structured manner to obtain information about problems in the use of e-learning, the nature of cognitive, and the process of capturing cognitive load during learning using LMS. By using a soft system methodology, the results from the interviews are mapped into a cognitive load-based LMS user model design. The initial model design includes information on working memory capacity, task performance (time, true/false rate), learning behavior (learner log), physiological (in a lab scale), and self-reporting (Likert scale). This model design is a promising first step towards a more technical process in developing adaptive and interactive systems.},

This study explores the factors that affect students’ commitment to Learning Management System (LMS) groups. A conceptual framework is developed that integrates social identity theory, DeLone and McLean’s information systems success model, and Hofstede’s cultural theory. By adopting a quantitative research design, 367 responses were gathered from university students. The data was analyzed using covariance-based structural equation modelling (CB-SEM). The findings reveal that factors such as LMS group identification, adherence to LMS group norms, perceived system quality, perceived service quality, and perceived information quality positively influence students’ commitment to the LMS group. Interestingly, collectivism as a cultural variable moderates the positive relationship between compliance with LMS group norms and commitment to LMS groups. Furthermore, uncertainty avoidance amplified the positive relationships that perceived system quality and information quality had with LMS group commitment. The model presented in this study offers significant predictive power concerning commitment to an LMS group. These findings will provide valuable insights for systems developers, higher education institutions, and instructors aiming to bolster online group commitment within LMS.},

The research sample is represented by 107 students enrolled into the optional subject of Business English. These students enrolled into the lessons individually on the basis of their specialist schedules and it was not possible to influence how many of them would be enrolled into the subject of Business English and into what days of Business English lessons. The students were divided randomly into the experimental and control groups. At the beginning of the course the students wrote the pre-test and at the end the post-test. The students of the experimental group were statistically significantly better in listening comprehension, they had exactly the same results in translation and writing as the control group, and very slightly worse results in vocabulary and reading comprehension than the control group, but not statistically significant. Nevertheless, the total results in post-tests were equal, there were not any statistically significant differences. We also analysed students´ questionnaires in which students expressed their opinions on e-learning effectiveness. The findings in the questionnaires proved that the students had positive attitude to e-learning.},

              ist ein Programm, das einen Rahmen für die gemeinsame Weiter- und Neuentwicklung von Lehrkonzepten bietet. Es wird als wirkungsvoller Hebel zur Gestaltung der Hochschulbildung verstanden. Das „Hoch drei“ symbolisiert die Kollaboration zwischen Studierenden, Lehrenden und Mitarbeitenden. Mithilfe dieser Zusammensetzung können Fächer- und Hochschulgrenzen durchbrochen werden, wodurch ein co-kreatives, rollenübergreifendes Arbeiten entsteht. Die Lehre wird spielerisch als „kaputtes Spiel“ betrachtet, um Anreize zu setzen, Motivationslücken zu erkennen und neue Ideen zu generieren. Das neunmonatige Programm basiert auf interdisziplinärer Zusammenarbeit, Kreativität und einem forschenden Ansatz zum Lehren und Lernen. Fünf Teams von verschiedenen Hochschulen für Angewandte Wissenschaften (HAWs) haben hierbei Lehrkonzepte entwickelt und verfeinert.

            Portfolio-Prüfungen werden immer beliebter. Das Projekt THDKomPort an der Technischen Hochschule Deggendorf hat Portfolio-Prüfungen im Rahmen verschiedener Pilotveranstaltungen evaluiert. Folgende Ergebnisse wurden konstatiert: Je nach Ausgestaltung der Lehrveranstaltung ergeben sich positive Effekte auf das studentische Lernen. Portfolio-Prüfungen gehen jedoch mit einem höheren Workload für Studierende und Lehrende einher. Insgesamt wurde das Potenzial von Portfolio-Prüfungen in den Pilotveranstaltungen nicht immer voll ausgeschöpft. Portfolio-Prüfungen sind ein gutes Instrument für Kompetenzorientiertes Prüfen, wenn Lehrveranstaltungen im Sinne von Constructive Alignment geplant und höhere Kompetenzniveaus abgebildet werden. Portfolio-Prüfungen werden daher vor allem für Lehrveranstaltungen, bei denen ein breites Spektrum an Kompetenzen in höheren kognitiven Niveaus erworben werden soll, empfohlen. Voraussetzung ist zudem eine Sensibilisierung der Lehrenden für Constructive Alignment.},

	abstract = {We propose the Delta ISMS method that strengthens the company-wide information security management system (ISMS) through incident learning. International standards of ISMS have been established to provide useful guidelines for information security risk management to organisations so they can respond appropriately to information security incidents. When the ISMS is first introduced to an organisation, the organisation is strengthened by introducing standard requirements. However, predicting everything and implementing a perfect ISMS may not be possible for each organisation. Thus, even in ISMS-certified organisations, information security incidents do not always diminish. This indicates that these organisations do not effectively carry out the PDCA cycle of the ISMS. We recognise that ISMS requires feedback and learning from incidents, while a sufficient explanation of learning procedures is not provided. Also, the Cyber Security Incident Response Team guidelines do not provide specific procedures for ‘incident learning’ explicitly. For incident learning, regularising informal knowledge (the formalisation of experience data) and double-loop learning (acquisition of company-wide knowledge from incident responses) is effective. Therefore, this study aims to develop detailed procedures for incident learning to run the second and subsequent rounds of the ISMS’s PDCA cycles. We propose an incident database operation method for regularising informal knowledge and a gold–silver–bronze communication method for implementing double loops. The procedures are routinely applied by headquarters under the supervision of the Chief Information Security Officer. By changing the safety factor in the damage reduction rate, it is possible to obtain multiple countermeasure candidate sets by considering the investment effect.},

	abstract = {The classiﬁcation of ships using remotely sensed data is increasingly vital for maritime security, environmental monitoring, and commercial applications. Advances in satellite imagery and remote sensing technologies have heightened the need for effective ship classiﬁcation algorithms. A key challenge lies in the variability of ship appearances due to size, shape, orientation, and environmental factors. Ensemble learning, which combines multiple classiﬁers for improved accuracy, has shown promise in this area. However, this method faces issues like increased memory and time complexity, and the inﬂuence of lower-quality models, highlighting the need for model pruning. This study presents a new approach to maritime management through the introduction of an ensemble learning system. The MAGNAT (Maritime mAnaGement eNsemble leArning sysTem) proposal and novel contribution in this paper represent an intelligent ensemble solution that signiﬁcantly enhances ship classiﬁcation in the maritime domain through the adoption of ensemble learning techniques. Incorporating various Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models into the training process, a novel aggregation strategy is devised to eliminate redundant models, retaining only those that actively enhance the learning process. Extensive experiments utilizing a renowned ship dataset were conducted to validate the effectiveness of the framework, ultimately demonstrating its superiority over conventional ensemble solutions.},

Learners with different goals, motivations and preferences may exhibit different behaviours when accessing these materials. These different behaviours may further affect their learning performance. The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between students’ interaction behaviours in online learning activities and their academic performance. In this study, including 214 students, the LMS was used for sharing course content, communicating with students, and conducting evaluations. At the end of the 14-week teaching period, the tracking data, which were obtained from the learning activities of the students, were analysed. A two-step clustering analysis was carried out to categorise students’ interactions with learning activities. Thus, it was determined that they had low, moderate, and high interactions, respectively. The normal distribution and homogeneity of variances of the variables were checked. ANOVA was used when assumptions were met, and the Kruskal-Wallis test was used when assumptions were met. A significant difference was found between the different behaviour clusters and students’ academic performance. This study showed that students with high levels of interaction according to behaviour patterns also performed well academically. In addition, students’ expectations and motivations for the course were collected and examined using a questionnaire.},

            This study investigates the effect of studying with topic maps provided by a self-developed language learning support system on (a) learning perception, (b) learning achievement and (c) variation in learning attitude and motivation, from the perspective of prior learning attitude, motivation and learning style. An analysis was conducted on the learning data of 90 participants for examining pre-test and post-test scores, learning perception, learning style indicators, attitude and motivation rankings before and after the study of target Japanese grammar content with the support of the system. The findings suggest that learners with high attitude/motivation perceived greater development of the habit of “learning from the comparison of related knowledge” and felt more satisfied with the learning situation in the system environment. Furthermore, the learners' attitude towards Japanese grammar learning and their motivation toward Japanese language learning were significantly stronger after the learning activity. It is also observed that (a) learner attitude towards Japanese grammar after studying with the system only had a positive correlation to prior attitudes; and (b) learner motivation towards Japanese language after studying with the system correlated highly with prior motivation and perception of development of the habit of “learning from the comparison of related knowledge.” Finally, from a learning style perspective, the analysis result suggests that “Global learners” expressed a stronger feeling about the usefulness of the comparison function of the system and their increment in motivation after using the system was higher than for “Sequential learners.” Moreover, between learning style indicators in the Sequential/Global dimension and level of learner expertise in the reported mental load scale, a significant interaction effect was found.},

Through empirical analysis, the paper highlights the porous boundaries of collaborative learning activities within a broader learning ecosystem, emphasizing the significance of personal emotions and social relations in educational contexts. The concept of "community of practice" is examined as a catalyst for transforming organizational cultures and enhancing participatory communication in learning environments. By proposing design principles that prioritize intergenerational, mixed-class, and intersectional dynamics, the paper underscores the importance of diversity and authentic feedback in fostering effective collaboration. Case studies illustrating successful collaborations underscore the importance of clear communication, shared goals, and supportive cultures. Ultimately, the paper offers insights for educators and researchers seeking to leverage digital technologies for enriching collaborative learning experiences within diverse communities of practice.},

Extractive summarization involves selecting key sentences directly from the source text, whereas abstractive summarization generates new sentences that convey the essential information. The chapter provides a comparative analysis of these two methods, evaluating their effectiveness in different contexts. With the advent of generative AI powered by deep learning models, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the ﬁeld of text summarization has seen signiﬁcant advancements. These AI-driven approaches offer enhanced capabilities for producing high-quality summaries that can signiﬁcantly improve information processing workﬂows across various industries.

While these frameworks have proven their value over decades, the emergence of AI technologies presents unprecedented opportunities for enhancement. This review synthesizes current research on how AI capabilities—including machine learning, natural language processing, and predictive analytics—can augment these traditional frameworks to improve their effectiveness and adaptability in the modern business landscape. The analysis reveals several key themes: (1) AI’s potential to process vast amounts of data for more comprehensive environmental scanning in SWOT and Porter’s analyses, (2) the use of predictive modeling to dynamically update BCG Matrix classifications and Blue Ocean opportunities, (3) real - time monitoring and adjustment of OKRs and Balanced Scorecard metrics through AI - driven dashboards, and (4) the integration of AI decision support systems in Hoshin Kanri and Agile methodologies. The review also identifies critical gaps in current research, particularly regarding the ethical implications of AI - enhanced strategic decision - making and the need for human oversight in strategic planning processes, contributing to both academic literature and practical application by providing a structured framework for the understanding of how AI can enhance rather than replace traditional strategic tools while highlighting areas requiring further research and development. The findings suggest that successfully integrating AI into these frameworks requires a balanced approach that leverages technological capabilities while preserving the human - centric aspects of strategic decision - making.},

The driving force underlying this chapter was the lack of effective stakeholder management in projects thought to be a contributing factor to the approximate 50\% project failure rate. Existing stakeholder management techniques in the project management body of knowledge were based on stakeholder theory from the strategic management discipline. This encourages decision-makers to consider the non-related interests of stock shareholders, customers, employees, suppliers, and the local community—such as ethics and social good. Those stakeholders are not necessarily as relevant in projects. In a project, the key stakeholders are those affected by WBS activities and deliverables. Therefore, a new simpliﬁed stakeholder management model was proposed by interviewing a panel of experienced project managers to document stakeholder identiﬁcation best practices. Machine learning, nonparametric Kruskal Wallis, and Chi-Square contingency analysis statistical techniques were applied to analyze the results. The empirical literature was reviewed to inform the development of two models, the ﬁrst for stakeholder analysis and the second for stakeholder engagement. Power and impact were argued to be the two key factors driving stakeholder analysis. A stakeholder engagement model was developed to leverage the stakeholder analysis.},

This chapter seeks to unravel the interplay between equivocality and governance, including the moderating effects of participants’ learning capabilities and their impact on project success, measured by either efﬁciency or value. Consequently, a conceptual framework grounded in the complex adaptive system model is outlined. Through a multiple-case analysis of collaborative R\&D projects, an inductive grounded theory approach is used to gain a deeper understanding of the four cases. Empirical data was gathered through open-ended interviews and archival data. The proposed framework delineates the ﬁndings of this chapter, enhancing comprehension of collaborative R\&D projects by modeling the interactions of governance, equivocality, and organizational learning as a complex adaptive system. From an academic perspective, this framework offers additional insights into the planning and control functions within collaborative R\&D projects.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mental disorders pose a major public health problem in most western countries. The demand for services for common mental health disorders has been on the rise despite the widespread accessibility of medication. Especially, the supply and demand for evidence-based psychotherapy do not align. Large-scale increase of modern psychotherapy is difficult with current methods of training which are often expensive, time consuming, and dependent on a small number of top-level professionals as trainers. E-learning has been proposed to enhance psychotherapy training accessibility, quality, and scalability.
OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aims to provide an overview of the current evidence regarding e-learning in psychotherapy training. In particular, the review examines the usability, acceptability, and learning outcomes associated with e-learning. Learning outcomes are assessed in different modalities including trainee experiences, knowledge acquisition, skill acquisition, and application of trained content in daily practice. Furthermore, the equivalence of web-based training and conventional training methods is evaluated.
METHODS: Following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, a search from Ovid, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Scopus databases between 2008 and June 2022 was conducted. Inclusion criteria required studies to describe e-learning systems for psychotherapy training and assess acceptability, feasibility, or learning outcomes. The risk of bias was evaluated for both randomized and nonrandomized studies. Learning outcomes were categorized using the Kirkpatrick model. Effect sizes comparing e-learning and traditional methods were calculated.
RESULTS: The search yielded 3380 publications, of which 34 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Positive learning outcomes are generally associated with various e-learning programs in psychotherapy training including trainee satisfaction, knowledge, and skill acquisition, and in application of trained content in clinical practice. Learning outcomes generally show equivalence between e-learning and conventional training methods. The overall effect size, indicating this disparity, was 0.01, suggesting no significant difference. This literature displays a high level of heterogeneity in e-learning solutions and assessment methods.
CONCLUSIONS: e-Learning seems to have good potential to enhance psychotherapy training by increasing access, scalability, and cost-effectiveness while maintaining quality in terms of learning outcomes. Results are congruent with findings related to e-learning in health education in general where e-learning as a pedagogy is linked to an opportunity to carry out learner-centric practices. Recommendations for conducting psychotherapy training programs in blended settings supported by activating learning methods are presented. However, due to the heterogeneity and limitations in the existing literature, further research is necessary to replicate these findings and to establish global standards for e-learning, as well as for the assessment of training outcomes in psychotherapy education. Research is especially needed on the effects of training on patient outcomes and optimal ways to combine e-learning and conventional training methods in blended learning settings.},

	doi = {10.3389/fdgth.2025.1455143},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Internet allows cancer patients to access information about their disease at any time. However, the quality of online information varies widely and is often inaccurate or does not provide all the details patients need to make informed decisions. Additionally, patients' often limited ability to find and evaluate cancer-related online information can lead to misinformation.
OBJECTIVE: An interactive e-learning environment to promote digital health literacy will be developed and evaluated for effectiveness.
PRIMARY HYPOTHESIS: Cancer patients who use the e-learning environment (IG1.1-IG1.3) or the content of the environment as a non-interactive PDF file (IG2) will show greater improvement in their digital health literacy from baseline to 8 weeks after baseline compared to patients who receive no such intervention, but are referred to a standard information brochure.
METHODS: The hypothesis will be tested in a stratified randomized controlled superiority trial with five parallel groups and the primary endpoint of digital health literacy. In an e-learning environment, patients will learn strategies to use when searching for reliable cancer-related online information. During development, a prototype will be refined through focus groups and tested for usability by experts and patients. 660 cancer patients will be recruited using convenience sampling and randomly assigned in a 3:1:1 ratio to IG1.1-IG1.3 (three variants of the environment), IG2, or the control group. Two thirds of the 660 participants will be recruited through the German Cancer Information Service (CIS) and one third through non-CIS routes. Allocation will follow stratified randomization, accounting for recruitment route (CIS vs. non-CIS) and cancer type (breast cancer vs. other cancers), with variable block length. The primary outcome, digital health literacy, will be measured at baseline, 2 weeks, and 8 weeks after baseline.
CONCLUSION: If the results support the primary hypothesis, then the e-learning environment could empower patients to retrieve more reliable information about their disease. Concerns about the generalizability of the results, since a disproportionate number of inquiries to the CIS come from breast cancer patients, are addressed by a proportionally stratified randomization strategy and diversified recruitment routes.},

As in the field of biochemistry, in which concepts are complex and procedures are integral to the information, e-learning has its advantages and drawbacks. This study was designed with the intention to examine the suitability of e-learning model in the context of biochemistry course, more specifically, it was to identify the extent to which digital learning environment supports students' understanding and real-life use of biochemical knowledge. Quantitative research comprises of the use of Survivors to obtain numerical data concerning the success of e-learning platforms concerning biochemistry. A survey is designed to have closed questions (such as the Likert scale) as well as demographic questions to capture. Closed questions measure participants' views on e-learning tools, its utility and instructional usefulness as well as the demographic questions, which give a précis of participant profile and their past experiences in e-learning. The learning objectives laid down for the course were specific, measurable, and generic and included topics, such as enzyme kinetics, metabolic pathways, and protein structures. These were grouped into topic-based weekly work schedule. These sessions revealed that students who were attending the biochemistry courses are different, in that 71\% of them agreed that the learning objectives for each of the modules, which were at the start of the course, served as a useful guide for understanding biochemistry as the learning objectives were well outlined at the start of the course. In about and through all of these recommendations, educational institutions will be able to design a more responsive and fair-blended e-learning environment that fosters success among learners and advanced understanding of biochemistry.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In addition to the medical school curriculum, medical students often take the initiative to incorporate external paid digital educational resources, especially during the pandemic. In this study, we organized an exemplary questionnaire method to enable evidence-based decisions before providing paid e-learning resources to medical students.
METHODS: An online form was distributed to all registered medical students at a Turkish medical school, and the compiled responses were subjected to statistical analysis. The participants were queried about their general background, post-graduation plans, use of study materials, purpose and perceived benefits of utilizing paid e-learning resources, as well as any financial burden or opinions regarding the associated costs.
RESULTS: A total of 119 medical students participated in the online form. The findings revealed that 87\% of the participants reported using paid e-learning resources for school exams, with 71.5\% of them indicating an improvement in their exam scores. Approximately 26.1\% of the participants did not specify any change. When asked to rate the cost of using paid e-learning resources on a scale of 1 to 10, the average score was 8.6 ± 1.58. Furthermore, 40\% of the participants relied on repeated free demo sessions, while only 27\% reported paying the fees associated with these resources.
CONCLUSIONS: With the evolution of medical education, particularly in the aftermath of the pandemic, medical students are increasingly seeking to supplement their medical curriculum, pursue self-interests, and engage in extracurricular research by utilizing paid e-learning resources. However, the costs associated with these resources often prevent some students from fully benefiting from them. Therefore, it is essential for medical schools to make evidence-based decisions to support their students, recognizing that digitally available resources play an integral role in the assimilation of medical education.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly accelerated the adoption of e-learning across educational institutions worldwide, especially in health professions education. This study explored the factors influencing e-learning acceptance among health professions students and faculty members in Iran using an extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among 932 participants, including faculty members, postgraduates, and undergraduates at Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, one of the top five universities in Iran. Data were collected through an online survey from August 1 to August 31, 2020. The TAM was extended by incorporating innovation, social, and organizational characteristics. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was used to analyze the relationships between constructs, including perceived ease of use (PEU), perceived usefulness (PU), and intention to use e-learning. The findings revealed that PEU and PU were pivotal in shaping e-learning acceptance, underscoring the need for user-friendly and effective platforms. Attitude toward e-learning significantly influenced participants' intention to use e-learning platforms, with PEU emerging as the most influential factor. PU had a more substantial impact on faculty members and undergraduate students, while postgraduates placed less emphasis on usefulness. Organizational factors only indirectly affected e-learning acceptance, mediated by individual characteristics. This study underscores the importance of usability, technological infrastructure, and digital literacy training in promoting e-learning acceptance among health professions students and faculty members. These findings significantly impact policymakers, educators, and administrators in designing more user-centered e-learning platforms. Future research should explore the longitudinal effects of technological advancements and institutional policies on e-learning adoption.},

However, general surgery residents are dissatisfied with current study methods and routines. As they progress through the new Entrustable Professional Activities (EPA) milestones, adapting content delivery to their learning preferences is crucial for engagement, a key element in the Kirkpatrick training evaluation model. This study explores general surgery residents' experiences, attitudes, and preferences toward e-learning to enhance instruction in the EPA era of surgical education.
METHODS: We used a convergent parallel design, distributing a national survey and conducting semi-structured interviews with general surgery residents from 22 U.S. institutions. The survey examined e-learning resource utilization, satisfaction, and financial investment in medical school and residency. Interviews provided insights into residents' desired features of effective e-learning. Data analysis included comparative statistics for survey results and reflexive thematic analysis for interviews.
RESULTS: The survey was completed by 106 general surgery residents. Residents reported higher satisfaction with e-learning resources utilized in medical school (e.g., UWorld, Sketchy Medical) than those in residency (e.g., TrueLearn, SCORE Web Portal) (mean difference = 0.4, 95\% CI = [0.3,0.5], p {\textless} 0.001). Learners' financial investment in USMLE preparation was significantly higher than for ABSITE (74\% vs. 21\% willing to spend {\textgreater}\$500; p {\textless} 0.001). Separately, 30 general surgery residents participated in semi-structured interviews, which highlighted preferences for mobile learning, multimedia, gamification, and competency-based assessments. Residents noted a gap between current e-learning resources and the EPA assessment paradigm.
CONCLUSIONS: General surgery residents find current e-learning resources in residency lacking clinical relevance and alignment with competency-based assessments. In the EPA era of surgical education, there is a need to develop innovative e-learning platforms that prepare residents for standardized examinations and support clinical competency development. Addressing these gaps will enhance the quality and efficiency of surgical training to better prepare residents for independent practice.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Practicing mindfulness is a mental process toward interoceptive awareness, achieving stress reduction and emotion regulation through brain-function alteration. Literature has shown that electroencephalography (EEG)-derived connectivity possesses the potential to differentiate brain functions between mindfulness naïve and mindfulness experienced, where such quantitative differentiation could benefit telediagnosis for mental health. However, there is no prior guidance in model selection targeting on the mindfulness-experience prediction. Here we hypothesized that the EEG effective connectivity could reach a good prediction performance in mindfulness experiences with brain interpretability.
METHODS: We aimed at probing direct Directed Transfer Function (dDTF) to classify the participants' history of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), and aimed at optimizing the prediction accuracy by comparing multiple machine learning (ML) algorithms. Targeting the gamma-band effective connectivity, we evaluated the EEG-based prediction of the mindfulness experiences across 7 machine learning (ML) algorithms and 3 sessions (i.e., resting, focus-breathing, and body-scan).
RESULTS: The support vector machine and naïve Bayes classifiers exhibited significant accuracies above the chance level across all three sessions, and the decision tree algorithm reached the highest prediction accuracy of 91.7 \% with the resting state, compared to the classification accuracies with the other two mindful states. We further conducted the analysis on essential EEG channels to preserve the classification accuracy, revealing that preserving just four channels (F7, F8, T7, and P7) out of 19 yielded the accuracy of 83.3 \%. Delving into the contribution of connectivity features, specific connectivity features predominantly located in the frontal lobe contributed more to classifier construction, which aligned well with the existing mindfulness literature.
CONCLUSION: In the present study, we initiated a milestone of developing an EEG-based classifier to detect a person's mindfulness experience objectively. The prediction accuracy of the decision tree was optimal to differentiate the mindfulness experiences using the local resting-state EEG data. The suggested algorithm and key channels on the mindfulness-experience prediction may provide guidance for predicting mindfulness experiences using the EEG-based classification embedded in future wearable neurofeedback systems or plausible digital therapeutics.},

	abstract = {In an era of rapid digital development, e-learning has become a significant trend in the educational field. Medical technology students need to acquire extensive theoretical knowledge and practical skills. E-learning can enhance learning experiences, improving students' understanding and application abilities. This study examined the impact of learning motivation, learning approaches, and learning burnout on the academic performance of medical technology students in an e-learning environment. This study conducted a quantitative survey on 37 medical technology students. The questionnaires included learning motivations, learning methods, and burnout, and responses provided on a 5-point Likert scale. First, the 37 students were categorized into three groups based on their academic performance. Then, differences between these groups were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test, and correlations between academic performance and questionnaire variables were calculated using Spearman correlation analysis. It revealed that motivation varies among different academic performance levels. Furthermore, in the high-grade group, self-efficacy (r = -0.502, p = 0.047), monitoring studying (r = 0.494, p = 0.032), and emotional exhaustion (r = 0.514, p = 0.024) were correlated to academic performance. In the middle-grade group, self-efficacy for learning and performance was correlated to academic performance (r = 0.858, p = 0.001). In the low-grade group, academic performance was correlated to depth approach (r = 0.826, p = 0.022) and organized studying (r = 0.833, p = 0.020). This study, through a quantitative survey, found significant differences in learning motivation, learning methods, and learning burnout among medical technology students with different academic performance levels. High-grade students demonstrated higher levels of emotional exhaustion, which may reflect feelings of overextension and academic burnout in e-learning environments; the academic performance of the middle-grade group was related to intrinsic motivation; and low-grade students showed a stronger correlation between their learning methods in e-learning and their academic performance. These insights underscore the necessity for personalized learning strategies to enhance educational outcomes effectively.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Limited digital literacy is a barrier for vulnerable patients accessing health care.
OBJECTIVE: The Stanford Technology Access Resource Team (START), a service-learning course created to bridge the telehealth digital divide, trained undergraduate and graduate students to provide hands-on patient support to improve access to electronic medical records (EMRs) and video visits while learning about social determinants of health.
METHODS: START students reached out to 1185 patients (n=711, 60\% from primary care clinics of a large academic medical center and n=474, 40\% from a federally qualified health center). Registries consisted of patients without an EMR account (at primary care clinics) or patients with a scheduled telehealth visit (at a federally qualified health center). Patient outcomes were evaluated by successful EMR enrollments and video visit setups. Student outcomes were assessed by reflections coded for thematic content.
RESULTS: Over 6 academic quarters, 57 students reached out to 1185 registry patients. Of the 229 patients contacted, 141 desired technical support. START students successfully established EMR accounts and set up video visits for 78.7\% (111/141) of patients. After program completion, we reached out to 13.5\% (19/141) of patients to collect perspectives on program utility. The majority (18/19, 94.7\%) reported that START students were helpful, and 73.7\% (14/19) reported that they had successfully connected with their health care provider in a digital visit. Inability to establish access included a lack of Wi-Fi or device access, the absence of an interpreter, and a disability that precluded the use of video visits. Qualitative analysis of student reflections showed an impact on future career goals and improved awareness of health disparities of technology access.
CONCLUSIONS: Of the patients who desired telehealth access, START improved access for 78.7\% (111/141) of patients. Students found that START broadened their understanding of health disparities and social determinants of health and influenced their future career goals.},

However, there is a lack of research in this area. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the experiences of undergraduate nursing students with e-learning during the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This qualitative-descriptive study focused on 12 undergraduate nursing students from the School of Nursing and Midwifery at Isfahan University of Medical Sciences. The participants were selected using purposive sampling. In-depth and semi-structured interviews were conducted to collect the data. The collected data were analyzed using MAXQDA10 and conventional content analysis. The study was conducted between May and September 2020.
RESULTS: Analysis of the findings led to the emergence of 11 subcategories and two main categories: E-Learning opportunities and Challenges of E-Learning, providing a comprehensive description of the experiences reported by the participants.
CONCLUSIONS: Unforeseen crises, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, can significantly affect the quality of education by disrupting face-to-face learning. To mitigate such disruptions, it is crucial to plan and establish infrastructure that supports alternative modes of education, such as e-learning. Additionally, providing training to students and educators on effectively utilizing digital platforms and producing electronic content can help ensure a smoother transition during crises.},

	abstract = {Screening high-risk populations is crucial for the prevention and treatment of kidney stones. Here, we employed radiomics to screen high-risk patients for kidney stones. A total of 513 independent kidneys from our hospital between 2020 and 2022 were randomly allocated to training and validation sets at a 7:3 ratio. Radiomic features were extracted using 3Dslicer software. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method was used to select radiomic features from the 107 extracted features, and logistic regression, decision tree, AdaBoost, and support vector machine (SVM) models were subsequently used to construct radiomic feature prediction models. Among these, the logistic regression algorithm demonstrated the best predictive performance and stability. The area under the curve (AUC) of the logistic regression model based on radiomic features was 0.858 in the training cohort and 0.806 in the validation cohort. Furthermore, univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the independent risk factors for kidney stones, which were gender and body mass index (BMI). Combining these independent risk factors improved the predictive performance of the model, with AUC values of 0.860 in the training cohort and 0.814 in the validation cohort. Clinical decision curve analysis (DCA) indicated that the radiomic model provided clinical benefit when the probability ranged from 0.2 to 1.0. The radiomic model has a good ability to screen high-risk patients with kidney stones, facilitating early intervention in kidney stone cases and improving patient prognosis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Buprenorphine for opioid use disorder (B-MOUD) is essential to improving patient outcomes; however, retention is essential.
OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate machine-learning algorithms predicting retention, overdoses, and all-cause mortality among US military veterans initiating B-MOUD.
METHODS: Veterans initiating B-MOUD from fiscal years 2006-2020 were identified. Veterans' B-MOUD episodes were randomly divided into training (80\%;n = 45,238) and testing samples (20\%;n = 11,309). Candidate algorithms [multiple logistic regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression, random forest (RF), gradient boosting machine (GBM), and deep neural network (DNN)] were used to build and validate classification models to predict six binary outcomes: 1) B-MOUD retention, 2) any overdose, 3) opioid-related overdose, 4) overdose death, 5) opioid overdose death, and 6) all-cause mortality. Model performance was assessed using standard classification statistics [e.g., area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC)].
RESULTS: Episodes in the training sample were 93.0\% male, 78.0\% White, 72.3\% unemployed, and 48.3\% had a concurrent drug use disorder. The GBM model slightly outperformed others in predicting B-MOUD retention (AUC-ROC = 0.72). RF models outperformed others in predicting any overdose (AUC-ROC = 0.77) and opioid overdose (AUC-ROC = 0.77). RF and GBM outperformed other models for overdose death (AUC-ROC = 0.74 for both), and RF and DNN outperformed other models for opioid overdose death (RF AUC-ROC = 0.79; DNN AUC-ROC = 0.78). RF and GBM also outperformed other models for all-cause mortality (AUC-ROC = 0.76 for both). No single predictor accounted for {\textgreater}3\% of the model's variance.
CONCLUSIONS: Machine-learning algorithms can accurately predict OUD-related outcomes with moderate predictive performance; however, prediction of these outcomes is driven by many characteristics.},

Robust continuing medical education (CME) programs represent major interventions to effectively teach quality improvement (QI) principles to practicing physicians. In particular, eLearning, a term describing online and distance learning interventions using digital tools, provides a means for CME interventions to reach broader audiences. Although there has been a focus on CME addressing QI, no knowledge synthesis has focused specifically on eLearning interventions. The purpose of this review was to examine the current landscape of eLearning interventions in QI-focused CME.
METHODS: We conducted a scoping review using the framework developed by Arksey and O'Malley as revised by Levac. We searched five databases and identified 2467 prospective publications, which two authors independently screened for inclusion. From each included article, two authors independently extracted data on the instructional modalities and QI tools used and met regularly to achieve consensus.
RESULTS: Twenty-one studies were included. Most studies used blended instruction ( n = 12) rather than solely eLearning interventions. Salient findings included the importance of coaching from QI experts and institutional support for planning and implementing eLearning interventions. Lack of protected time and resources for participants were identified as barriers to participation in CME activities, with small practices being disproportionately affected.
DISCUSSION: Partnerships between CME developers and sponsoring organizations are vital in creating sustainable eLearning interventions for QI-focused CME. Remote coaching can be an effective strategy to provide ongoing support to geographically separated learners.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2024.105535},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Complexities in older patient care and frequent polypharmacy requires tailored tools, specific skills and interdisciplinary collaborations. Traditional disease-centered education often overlooks these issues. Despite digital gamification's relevance in health education, limited exploration exists for gamified platforms addressing polypharmacy, especially within comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA).
OBJECTIVE: This study outlines Optipharm's design, a gamified e-learning tool designed to enhance health students' education in managing polypharmacy among older adults. It also assesses its usability using a validated scale.
METHODS: Optipharm development utilized gamification techniques guided by pedagogical principles. Learning objectives addressed clinical and educational gaps in older adult care. Hosted on a Moodle system, the platform housed a structured clinical case as a SCORM file, a usability scale, a certificate of achievement, and a literature library. Optipharm was assessed by 304 medical students from the University of Navarre, Spain, using the SUS-G-Sp scale.
RESULTS: An immersive gamified e-learning tool simulating clinical practice settings was developed, requiring users to assume the role of healthcare professionals in multidisciplinary outpatient consultations. The interface, with a 2D cartoon-style aesthetic, aligns with learning objectives, integrating engaging storytelling and clear instructions for CGA in Phase 1 and pharmacological optimization in Phase 2. The evaluation of Optipharm's usability revealed very positive perceptions among users, with high agreement rates on usability items.
CONCLUSION: Optipharm represents a pioneering gamified tool designed to simulate clinical scenarios, allowing users to engage as healthcare professionals within multidisciplinary teams and address medication-related challenges in older patients with polypharmacy. It provides a secure, interactive learning environment with clear educational objectives and seamless integration of gamification elements, enhancing users' knowledge and skills in managing complex medication regimens. As a platform for experiential learning and knowledge exchange, Optipharm contributes to shaping the future of health education and fostering a culture of patient-centred care among future healthcare professionals.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Medical students gain essential skills through hospital training and internships, which complement their theoretical education. However, virtual patient platforms have been shown to effectively promote clinical reasoning and enhance learning outcomes. This study evaluates a web-based platform designed for learning clinical reasoning in cardiovascular diseases, detailing its functionalities and user satisfaction.
METHODS: The Virtual Patient platform presents medical students with clinically valid scenarios, encompassing stages such as patient description, anamnesis, objective examination, presumptive diagnosis, health investigations, treatment planning, complications, differential and final diagnoses, and prognosis. Scenarios are generated either automatically or manually by professors, based on labeled and annotated clinical data. The Virtual Patient contains two types of medical cases: simple scenarios describing patients with one pathology, and complex scenarios describing patients with several related pathologies. The platform was evaluated by a total of 210 users: 178 medical students, 7 professors, and 25 engineering students, using questionnaires adjusted for each evaluation round to assess satisfaction and gather feedback. The evaluation by medical students was performed in four rounds, each round corresponding to successive enhancements of the platform functionalities and addition of new cases, with a total number of 1,098 evaluation sessions.
RESULTS: The platform was evaluated at different implementation stages, involving simple and complex scenarios for various heart diseases. The majority of students found the platform very useful (82.58\%), with significant appreciation for its features and functionalities, for example the dialogue module supporting natural language interactions in Romanian and English or the feed-back obtained during interaction. Professors highly valued the platform's flexibility in scenario generation, real-time feedback provision, and data management capabilities. They appreciated the possibility to provide feedback and score student performance in real-time or after the session, though some professors suggested improving the explainability of the scores.
CONCLUSIONS: The Virtual Patient platform enables medical students to virtually replicate hospital interactions, diagnose patients, and plan treatments in clinically valid scenarios for cardiovascular diseases. User evaluations demonstrated high satisfaction and appreciation for the platform's features. Future work will focus on expanding medical cases, enhancing the dialogue module, improving scenario generation for complex cases, and extending the synthetic data generation component to produce additional types of medical investigations.},

	abstract = {Globally, inadequate healthcare provider (HCP) proficiency with evidence-based guidelines contributes to millions of newborn, infant, and child deaths each year. HCP guideline proficiency would improve patient outcomes. Conventional (in person) HCP in-service education is limited in 4 ways: reach, scalability, adaptability, and the ability to contextualize. Adaptive e-learning environments (AEE), a subdomain of e-learning, incorporate artificial intelligence technology to create a unique cognitive model of each HCP to improve education effectiveness. AEEs that use existing internet access and personal mobile devices may overcome limits of conventional education. This paper provides an overview of the development of our AEE HCP in-service education, Pediatric Acute Care Education (PACE). PACE uses an innovative approach to address HCPs' proficiency in evidence-based guidelines for care of newborns, infants, and children. PACE is novel in 2 ways: 1) its patient-centric approach using clinical audit data or frontline provider input to determine content and 2) its ability to incorporate refresher learning over time to solidify knowledge gains. We describe PACE's integration into the Pediatric Association of Tanzania's (PAT) Clinical Learning Network (CLN), a multifaceted intervention to improve facility-based care along a single referral chain. Using principles of co-design, stakeholder meetings modified PACE's characteristics and optimized integration with CLN. We plan to use three-phase, mixed-methods, implementation process. Phase I will examine the feasibility of PACE and refine its components and protocol. Lessons gained from this initial phase will guide the design of Phase II proof of concept studies which will generate insights into the appropriate empirical framework for (Phase III) implementation at scale to examine effectiveness.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the context of the coronavirus pandemic, countless face-to-face events as well as medical trainings were cancelled or moved to online courses, which resulted in increased digitalization in many areas. In the context of medical education, videos provide tremendous benefit for visualizing skills before they are practised.
METHODS: Based on a previous investigation of video material addressing epidural catheterization available on the YouTube platform, we aimed to investigate new content produced in the context of the pandemic. Thus, a video search was conducted in May 2022.
RESULTS: We identified twelve new videos since the pandemic with a significant improvement in the new content in terms of procedural items (p = 0.03) compared to the prepandemic video content. Video content released in the course of the COVID-19 pandemic was more often created by private content creators and were significantly shorter in total runtime than those from university and medical societies (p = 0.04).
CONCLUSION: The profound changes in the learning and teaching of health care education in relation to the pandemic are largely unclear. We reveal improved procedural quality of predominantly privately uploaded content despite a shortened runtime compared to the prepandemic period. This might indicate that technical and financial hurdles to producing instructional videos by discipline experts have decreased. In addition to the teaching difficulties caused by the pandemic, this change is likely to be due to validated manuals on how to create such content. The awareness that medical education needs to be improved has grown, so platforms offer specialized sublevels for high-quality medical videos.},

	abstract = {Serious games may resolve problems relating to low motivation in complex medical topics such as anatomy. However, they remain relatively novel introductions to the science of learning, and further research is required to ascertain their benefits. This study describes the overall development and testing of a digital serious boardgame designed to facilitate the rehearsal of musculoskeletal anatomy based on self-determination theory with considerations for the psychological state of Flow. It was hypothesized that students assigned to the intervention game condition would attain higher Flow scores, a measure of engagement and intrinsic motivation, than students assigned to the game-free control, and that the intervention condition would report either superior or non-superior, but not inferior, scores on a surprise recall test. A total of 36 second-year undergraduate medical students participated in the quasi-randomized controlled trial, where the intervention groups went first and randomly drew questions that were mirrored into the control groups. All students were administered an identical 10-question baseline assessment before their interventions, the Short Flow Scale immediately after, and a surprise test four-to-six weeks later. Independent samples t-tests indicated that students of both conditions were of similar baseline knowledge (t = 0.7, p = 0.47), significantly higher Flow scores in the game condition (t = 2.99, p = 0.01), and no significant differences between surprise test scores (t = -0.3, p = 0.75). The game appears to be an appropriate game-based tool for student rehearsal of anatomical education, stemming from a strong theoretical base that facilitates high engagement and intrinsic motivation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Over the last decade, developments in e-Learning and technologies are creating the groundwork for health sciences and medical education. Literature demonstrates that we have yet to reach any form of consensus about which indicators are needed to assess and teach quality health sciences and medical education through technology or innovation. There is, therefore, a greater need for a tool or platform that is properly constructed, validated and tested within health sciences.
METHODS: This paper presents a study, which is part of a larger research project assessing staff and students' perceptions of the importance and relevance of different aspects of e-Learning and mHealth in health sciences curricula at four universities in South Africa. The specific objectives of this study were to: (i) assess health sciences staffs' perceptions and understanding of these two applications; and (ii) establish challenges and opportunities of e-Learning and mHealth applications in the health sector, as well as perceptions on the importance and relevance of these applications to their curricula and future practices. A combination of Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) and a key-informant interview was used. A total of 19 staff from four universities participated. Atlast.ti was used for the data analysis and the findings were coded using a primarily deductive thematic coding framework.
RESULTS: The findings revealed that not all staff members are equipped or trained with new applications or technologies, such as mHealth. Most participants believed that diverse technologies and tools could be integrated with mHealth and e-Learning. Furthermore, participants agree that a new multi-modal platform, in the form of a learning management system (LMS) with relevant applications (and possible plugins) integrated, tailored towards health sciences will benefit all stakeholders, and be valuable to higher education and health sectors.
CONCLUSIONS: Digitalisation as well as digital citizenship is gradually being integrated into teaching and learning. It is imperative to adapt the health sciences curricula through constructive alignments and promote health sciences education in the current 4IR. This would allow graduates to be better prepared for digitalised practice environments.},

The question now is to determine a way in which to capitalize on this momentum of digitization and harness the medical e-learning content created for the future. We have analyzed the transition of a pathology course to an emergency remote education online course and, in the second step, applied a flipped classroom approach including research skills training.
METHODS: In the summer semester of 2020, the pathology course at the Technical University of Munich was completely converted to an asynchronous online course. Its content was adapted in winter 2021 and incorporated into a flipped classroom concept in which research skills were taught at the same time.
RESULTS: Screencasts and lecture recordings were the most popular asynchronous teaching formats. Students reported developing a higher interest in pathology and research through group work. The amount of content was very challenging for some students.
CONCLUSION: Flipped classroom formats are a viable option when using pre-existing content. We recommend checking such content for technical and didactic quality and optimizing it if necessary. Content on research skills can be combined very well with clinical teaching content.},

	abstract = {Introduction Focused Cardiac Ultrasound (FOCUS) is an essential tool for rapid cardiac assessment across various clinical subspecialties. Consequently, teaching foundational FOCUS skills is of critical importance. This study investigates the effectiveness of e-learning in imparting FOCUS skills. Materials and methods This prospective, controlled study assessed competency development among medical students attending a FOCUS workshop (study group) at two time points: T1 (pre-training) and T2 (post-training, after completing e-learning). The competence gain of the group was compared to a reference group (control group) of physicians who had also used the e-learning in preparation for a certified FOCUS workshop. Objective competencies were measured at both time points using short-answer and multiple-choice theory tests. Subjective self-assessments of competencies and opinions of the e-learning were investigated through evaluation forms at T2 using a 7-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree). Demographic information was collected at T1, and user behaviour during e-learning was assessed at T2. Primary endpoints were the increase in theoretical competencies (study group) and the comparison of subjective and objective competency levels (study vs. reference).
Results A total of 104 participants (study group = 48; reference group = 56) were included. The study group exhibited a significant (p {\textless} 0.001) increase in theoretical competencies. However, at T2 the reference group achieved significantly higher theoretical test scores (p {\textless} 0.001). One influencing factor was previous practical experience (p = 0.02), which was significantly higher in the reference group (p {\textless} 0.001). Both groups estimated their competency at the end of preparation to be at similar levels (4.3 ± 0.9 scalepoints [SP] versus 4.3 ± 1.0 SP; p = 0.94). Evaluation results of the e-learning were positive in both groups (5.8 ± 0.9 SP versus 6.2 ± 0.7 SP; p = 0.04), with results in the reference group being significantly higher.
Conclusion Both the improvement in competencies and the positive reception of digital learning media should encourage the increased implementation of e-learning formats. This study shows that such formats in ultrasound training can effectively complement face-to-face workshops and should be included in certified training curricula.

	abstract = {Background With rapid advancements in medical sciences, minimally invasive surgical techniques such as laparoscopy have replaced traditional open surgeries. Enhancing the clinical competence and professional commitment of operating room nurses can empower nurses and directly impact surgical outcomes and patient safety.
Methods A quasi-experimental pre-test-post-test control group design was employed. Ninety-four students were selected through convenience sampling and randomly allocated to two groups: an intervention group (n = 47) and a control group (n = 47). The intervention group received five sessions for training on laparoscopic surgical principles using E-learning, video demonstrations, and participatory methods. The control group received training using lectures and PowerPoint presentation. Data was collected using a demographic questionnaire, perceived perioperative competence scale- revised (PPCS-R), and the nursing professional commitment scale (NPCS), before and two weeks after the intervention.
Results There was no significant difference in the mean scores of clinical competence and professional commitment between the two groups at baseline (P {\textgreater} 0.05). After the intervention, the mean score of clinical competence in the intervention group was significantly higher than the control group (p = 0.005). However, there was no significant difference in the mean score of professional commitment between the two groups after the intervention (P = 0.261).
Conclusion Using a combined learning approach in laparoscopic surgery led to a significant increase in the clinical skills of nursing students, resulting in improved performance in the clinical setting. However, to further generalize the results, similar studies with larger sample sizes and in different educational settings are recommended.},
