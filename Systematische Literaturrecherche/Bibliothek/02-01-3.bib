	abstract = {The COVID-pandemic measures, restricting physical distancing and lockdown in 2020, had fundamental effects on all aspects of life, including face-to-face group methods, like psychodrama. This situation provided a unique opportunity to study the effects of unavoidable environmental interruptions on psychodrama groups and the leaders’ roles and responses in such situations. We invited Hungarian psychodrama leaders to describe their experiences with their ongoing groups. They completed two online questionnaires; the ﬁrst was after the initial lock-down and the second during the next wave of the pandemic. Results showed the risk factors and protection regarding the stress on leaders during the interruption and their immediate and lasting consequences after the reunion of the group. In addition, to using role reversal and mirror technique questions, the emerging themes and patterns of their experiences and their key learning regarding interruption and online group sessions were also identiﬁed.},

	abstract = {Interdisciplinary research-based learning in medical ethics offers medical students the opportunity to gain practical research experience, to critically engage with their own traditions of medical science and to develop a normatively informed attitude. At the Ruhr-University Bochum, a researchbased learning course in medical ethics was established starting with the summer semester 2018. With the onset of the Corona pandemic, this concept had to be transformed to an online format. In this article, we describe the transformation into an online course. Three hypotheses were formulated for the conversion. These were concerned with 1) the didactic conception, 2) factors of a technical mediation, and 3) increasing complexity. According to these hypotheses, a didactic setting was developed and the course content was adapted. Based on the experiences of the implementation, we finally discuss essential factors for a successful transfer from the teachers’ point of view.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nursing as a professional education must have a solid professional foundation to encourage nursing professionals’ attitude, behavior, and ability to carry out the nursing practice. AIM: This study aims to review the effectiveness of virtual simulations (vSIMs) in clinical nursing education in increasing the clinical knowledge and skills of new nurses and nursing students.
METHODS: A literature review using the PRISMA method from the online database Science Direct, Scopus, and PubMed with the keywords vSIM, clinical nursing education, knowledge, and nursing skills from 2016 to 2020.
RESULTS: It was found that 162 articles were found. Then, 25 articles can be reviewed based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. The reviewed articles used a quasi-experimental design. While articles in the form of pilot projects, literature/systematic reviews, qualitative, and descriptive studies were excluded from the study. Based on the review of articles, it was found that, on average, they discussed the effectiveness of vSIMs used in the clinical learning process in hospitals. It can be applied to new nurses and nursing students.
CONCLUSION: Virtual simulation is useful for learning new skills; practicing skills that combine content, critical thinking, and psychomotor elements; learning skills competencies, and the ability to make decisions. In the era of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic, vSIM is a safe and realistic nursing education technology for nurses and nursing students.},

	abstract = {Background: Perioperative nursing requires specialised education that offers professional development to ensure high-­quality nursing care and patient safety in acute situations. Interprofessional simulation-­based learning exposes students to acute situations in a safe environment without the risk of harming the patient, and it prepares postgraduate nursing students for clinical practice. Despite extensive research regarding simulation-­based learning, there is a lack of knowledge on what impact such training has on perioperative nursing students after graduation. Design: An explorative qualitative design was used, and this study is reported in accordance with the COREQ guidelines.
Method: Between March 2019–­November 2020, 16 perioperative nurses participated in semi-­structured individual interviews three to five months after their graduation from five different educational institutions. During their postgraduate education, they had participated in interprofessional simulation-­based learning that included acute clinical situations. A phenomenological hermeneutical analysis was applied to the data involving three steps: naïve reading, structural analysis and comprehensive understanding.
Results: During the naïve reading, three themes emerged: competence in handling acute situations, competence in interprofessional teamwork and professional identity development.
Conclusion: Interprofessional simulation-­based learning in perioperative nursing education developed relevant and important competence, including professional identity},

In this paper we will present a case study of a successful collaborative learning design. This involves a near synchronous online seminar where students work in small groups to produce a report that examines media coverage of controversial science, using archives of television news reports. We will analyze the activity's task design features by employing a framework of collaboration enabling design approach proposed by Kirschner et al (2004). We will start with an analysis of the collaborative processes and interaction among participants in this online activity. Then we will examine the features of the task used in this learning environment with respect to the interaction design ideas proposed by Kirschner et al. They suggest that the use of appropriately designed and implemented educational, social and technological affordances is the foundation for stimulating, motivating and maintaining collaboration among learners. We use the framework to identify factors contributing to the success of the activity.},

	abstract = {Im Jahr 2020 sollte die 13. Tagung Psychologiedidaktik und Evaluation in Salzburg stattfinden. Die Zahl der Beitragsanmeldungen war erfreulich hoch und alles war vorbereitet. Aufgrund der Coronakrise musste die Tagung schweren Herzens abgesagt werden. Dank der Sektion Aus-, Fort- und Weiterbildung im Berufsverband Deutscher Psychologinnen und Psychologen können die Beiträge zur Tagung dennoch veröffentlicht werden. Was erwartet Sie in diesem Sammelband? Nur einige Schlaglichter seien erwähnt: In Deutschland wurde 2019 das novellierte Psychotherapeutengesetz ver abschiedet. Das Gesetz wird nicht nur die Ausbildung der Psychotherapeutinnen und Psychotherapeuten verändern, sondern auch weitreichende Auswirkungen auf das Studienangebot und das Berufsfeld der Psychologinnen und Psychologen außerhalb der Psychotherapie haben. Schon in den vorhergehenden Bänden wurde die kontrovers geführte Diskussion um die Gesetzesnovelle dokumentiert. Zentralen Inhalte des novellierten Gesetzes werden vorgestellt und deren mögliche Konsequenzen erwähnt. Psychologie gehört zu den Studiengängen mit der höchsten Nachfrage. Zwei Beiträge beschäftigen sich mit Grundlegungen der Psychologiedidaktik. Thematisiert werden weiterhin Einflussfaktoren auf die Studienwahl, auch im Vergleich unterschiedlicher Fächer. Psychologie in Schulen bildet einen Schwerpunkt in dem vorliegenden Band, insbesondere was psychologischen Anteile der Lehramtsausbildung anbelangt. Hervor gehoben sei ein Artikel, der das Curriculum des neu eingerichteten Studiengangs für das Lehramt im Fach Psychologie an der Uni Paderborn vorstellen. Lehr- und Lernmethoden werden in verschiedenen Anwendungsfeldern thematisiert. Abgerundet wird die Sammlung der Beiträge durch den Schwerpunkt Evaluation. Dabei werden unter anderem die Vermittlung einer wissenschaftlichen Haltung, das problembasierte Lernen und die Studierendengesundheit thematisiert. Die vielfältigen Anwendungsbeispiele weisen auf das große Spektrum des pädagogisch-psychologischen Einsatzfelds hin.},

	abstract = {Introduction Despite the growing investment in and adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine, the applications of AI in an emergency setting remain unclear. This scoping review seeks to identify available literature regarding the applications of AI in emergency medicine. Methods The scoping review was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for scoping reviews using Medline-OVID, EMBASE, CINAHL, and IEEE, with a double screening and extraction process. The search included articles published until February 28, 2020. Articles were excluded if they did not self-classify as studying an AI intervention, were not relevant to the emergency department (ED), or did not report outcomes or evaluation. Results Of the 1483 original database citations, 395 were eligible for full-text evaluation. Of these articles, a total of 150 were included in the scoping review. The majority of included studies were retrospective in nature (n = 124, 82.7\%), with only 3 (2.0\%) prospective controlled trials. We found 37 (24.7\%) interventions aimed at improving diagnosis within the ED. Among the 150 studies, 19 (12.7\%) focused on diagnostic imaging within the ED. A total of 16 (10.7\%) studies were conducted in the out-of-hospital environment (eg, emergency medical services, paramedics) with the remainder occurring either in the ED or the trauma bay. Of the 24 (16\%) studies that had human comparators, there were 12 (8\%) studies in which AI interventions outperformed clinicians in at least 1 measured outcome. Conclusion AI-related research is rapidly increasing in emergency medicine. There are several promising AI interventions that can improve emergency care, particularly for acute radiographic imaging and prediction-based diagnoses. Higher quality evidence is needed to further assess both short- and long-term clinical outcomes.},

Auf Grundlage einer Online-Befragung mit 3.995 Müttern und Vätern von Grundschulkindern soll im Besonderen der Frage nachgegangen werden, inwieweit Unterschiede im emotionalen Erleben beim Fernunterricht durch das berufliche didaktische Wissen und die Arbeitssituation der Eltern erklärt werden können. Dazu wurden vier Gruppen von Eltern vor ihrem beruflichen Hintergrund betrachtet. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass insbesondere Eltern, die als Lehrkräfte tätig sind, sich geringer beansprucht fühlen, weniger ängstlich sind und deutlich begeisterterer sind, ihre Kinder zuhause beim Lernen zu begleiten. Mit Blick auf diese Ergebnisse wird abschließend diskutiert, wie Eltern-Lehrer*innen-Beziehungen in Zukunft pädagogisch günstig für den Lernerfolg der Schüler*innen ausgestaltet werden können und welche Funktion dabei erweiterte hybride Unterrichtskonzepte erfüllen.},

Recent instructional theories stress authentic learning tasks as the driving force for learning, but due to the complexity of those tasks learning may be hampered by the limited processing capacity of the human mind.

            The COVID-19 pandemic has made access to face-to-face learning opportunities—the most common form of adult learning—impossible. Many firms have scaled back their training investments due to economic uncertainty. One way to fill these gaps is through self-directed learning via the Internet. Learning opportunities via apps and online videos are available flexibly in terms of time and location. But can online learning substitute for the lack of face-to-face courses, especially in the workplace where constant skill updating becomes ever more important? We wanted to know if online learning opportunities were used more in the first months of the pandemic, and if so, for which purposes and by which groups. Using data from the Adult Cohort of the German National Educational Panel Study (NEPS-SC6) and a supplementary web survey conducted in May and June 2020, we show that the work-related use of online learning was stronger in these months than before the crisis. At the same time, however, educational inequalities in the use of such opportunities were larger than before the pandemic. Thus, the expansion of online learning seems to benefit highly educated workers rather than educationally disadvantaged groups.

            Zusammenfassung
            Die COVID-19-Pandemie hat den Zugang zu Lerngelegenheiten in Präsenz – der häufigsten Form des Lernens im Erwachsenenalter – unmöglich gemacht. Viele Betriebe haben auf Grund der wirtschaftlichen Unsicherheit ihre Weiterbildungsinvestitionen heruntergefahren. Eine Möglichkeit, diese Lücken zu füllen, ist das selbstgesteuerte Lernen über das Internet. Lernangebote über Apps oder Online-Videos sind zeitlich und räumlich flexibel verfügbar. Aber können Onlineangebote das Lernen in Präsenz insbesondere in der Arbeitswelt, die von immer stärkeren Lernanforderungen geprägt ist, ersetzen? Wir wollten wissen, ob Online-Angebote in den ersten Monaten der Pandemie verstärkt genutzt wurden, und wenn ja, zu welchem Zweck und von welchen Gruppen. Mit den Daten der Erwachsenenkohorte des Nationalen Bildungspanels (NEPS-SC6) sowie einer Zusatzerhebung, die im Mai und Juni 2020 durchgeführt wurde, können wir zeigen, dass die berufliche Nutzung von Online-Lernangeboten während der ersten Monate tatsächlich stärker war. Gleichzeitig haben sich Bildungsungleichheiten in der Nutzung solcher Angebote jedoch verstärkt. Von der Ausweitung des Online-Lernens scheinen eher Hochgebildete zu profitieren und nicht „bildungsferne“ Gruppen.},

	abstract = {Background: Nurses play an important role in detecting patients with clinical deterioration. However, the problem of nurses failing to trigger deteriorating ward patients still persists despite the implementation of a patient safety initiative, the Rapid Response System. A Web-based simulation was developed to enhance nurses? role in recognizing and responding to deteriorating patients. While studies have evaluated the effectiveness of the Web-based simulation on nurses? clinical performance in a simulated environment, no study has examined its impact on nurses? actual practice in the clinical setting. Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of Web-based simulation on nurses' recognition of and response to deteriorating patients in clinical settings. The outcomes were measured across all levels of Kirkpatrick?s 4-level evaluation model with clinical outcome on triggering rates of deteriorating patients as the primary outcome measure. Methods: A before-and-after study was conducted on two general wards at an acute care tertiary hospital over a 14-month period. All nurses from the two study wards who undertook the Web-based simulation as part of their continuing nursing education were invited to complete questionnaires at various time points to measure their motivational reaction, knowledge, and perceived transfer of learning. Clinical records on cases triggered by ward nurses from the two study wards were evaluated for frequency and types of triggers over a period of 6 months pre- and 6 months postintervention. Results: The number of deteriorating patients triggered by ward nurses in a medical general ward increased significantly (P{\textless}.001) from pre- (84/937, 8.96\%) to postintervention (91/624, 14.58\%). The nurses reported positively on the transfer of learning (mean 3.89, SD 0.49) from the Web-based simulation to clinical practice. A significant increase (P{\textless}.001) on knowledge posttest score from pretest score was also reported. The nurses also perceived positively their motivation (mean 3.78, SD 0.56) to engage in the Web-based simulation. Conclusions: This study provides evidence on the effectiveness of Web-based simulation in improving nursing practice when recognizing and responding to deteriorating patients. This educational tool could be implemented by nurse educators worldwide to address the educational needs of a large group of hospital nurses responsible for patients in clinical deterioration.},

The analysis enables identification of factors intervening in this workload as well as planning of overload prevention for educational activities using these technologies. Objective: To analyze the mental workload of an educational intervention with the Mobile Virtual Learning Object for the Assessment of Acute Pain in adults and newborns, according to the NASA Task Load Index criteria. Methods: A methodological study with data collected from 5 nurses and 75 students, from November of 2013 to February of 2014. Results: The highest students? and specialists? means were in the dimensions of ?Mental demand? (57.20 � 22.27; 51 � 29.45) and ?Performance? (58.47 � 24.19; 73 � 28.85). The specialists? mental workload index was higher (50.20 � 7.28) when compared with students? (47.87 � 16.85) on a scale from 0 to 100 (P=.557). Conclusions: The instrument allowed for the assessment of mental workload after an online educational intervention with a mobile learning virtual object. An excessive overload was not identified among participants. Assessing mental workload from the use of educational technologies at the end of a task is a key to their applicability, with the aim of providing a more effective, stimulating, and long-lasting experience of the learning process.},

	abstract = {Background: The impact of the use of video resources in primarily paper-based problem-based learning (PBL) settings has been widely explored. Although it can provide many benefits, the use of video can also hamper the critical thinking of learners in contexts where learners are developing clinical reasoning. However, the use of video has not been explored in the context of interactive virtual patients for PBL. Objective: A pilot study was conducted to explore how undergraduate medical students interpreted and evaluated information from video- and text-based materials presented in the context of a branched interactive online virtual patient designed for PBL. The goal was to inform the development and use of virtual patients for PBL and to inform future research in this area. Methods: An existing virtual patient for PBL was adapted for use in video and provided as an intervention to students in the transition year of the undergraduate medicine course at St George?s, University of London. Survey instruments were used to capture student and PBL tutor experiences and perceptions of the intervention, and a formative review meeting was run with PBL tutors. Descriptive statistics were generated for the structured responses and a thematic analysis was used to identify emergent themes in the unstructured responses. Results: Analysis of student responses (n=119) and tutor comments (n=18) yielded 8 distinct themes relating to the perceived educational efficacy of information presented in video and text formats in a PBL context. Although some students found some characteristics of the videos beneficial, when asked to express a preference for video or text the majority of those that responded to the question (65\%, 65/100) expressed a preference for text. Student responses indicated that the use of video slowed the pace of PBL and impeded students? ability to review and critically appraise the presented information. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that text was perceived to be a better source of information than video in virtual patients for PBL. More specifically, the use of video was perceived as beneficial for providing details, visual information, and context where text was unable to do so. However, learner acceptance of text was higher in the context of PBL, particularly when targeting clinical reasoning skills. This pilot study has provided the foundation for further research into the effectiveness of different virtual patient designs for PBL.},

	abstract = {Background: Mobile learning has become an essential instruction platform in many schools, colleges, universities, and various other educational institutions across the globe, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. The resulting severe, pandemic-related circumstances have disrupted physical and face-to-face contact teaching practices, thereby requiring many students to actively use mobile technologies for learning. Mobile learning technologies offer viable web-based teaching and learning platforms that are accessible to teachers and learners worldwide. Objective: This study investigated the use of mobile learning platforms for instruction purposes in United Arab Emirates higher education institutions. Methods: An extended technology acceptance model and theory of planned behavior model were proposed to analyze university students? adoption of mobile learning platforms for accessing course materials, searching the web for information related to their disciplines, sharing knowledge, and submitting assignments during the COVID-19 pandemic. We collected a total of 1880 questionnaires from different universities in the United Arab Emirates. Partial least squares-structural equation modeling and machine learning algorithms were used to assess the research model, which was based on the data gathered from a student survey. Results: Based on our results, each hypothesized relationship within the research model was supported by our data analysis results. It should also be noted that the J48 classifier (89.37\% accuracy) typically performed better than the other classifiers when it came to the prediction of the dependent variable. Conclusions: Our study revealed that teaching and learning could considerably benefit from adopting remote learning systems as educational tools during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the value of such systems could be lessened because of the emotions that students experience, including a fear of poor grades, stress resulting from family circumstances, and sadness resulting from a loss of friends. Accordingly, these issues can only be resolved by evaluating the emotions of students during the pandemic.},

	abstract = {Background: Dementia education that meets quality and safety standards is paramount to ensure a highly skilled dementia care workforce. Web-based education provides a flexible and cost-effective medium. To be successful, Web-based education must contain features that promote learning and support knowledge translation into practice. The Dementia Care Competency and Training Network (DCC\&TN) has developed an innovative Web-based program that promotes improvement of the attitudes, knowledge, skills, behavior, and practice of clinicians, regardless of their work setting, in order to improve the quality of life for people living with dementia. Objective: This review aims to (1) determine the key features that are associated with an effective and functional Web-based education program?an effective and functional Web-based program is defined as one that measures results, is accessible, is user friendly, and translates into clinical practice?and (2) determine how these features correlate with the DCC\&TN. Methods: Six electronic databases?Medline, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), AusHealth, Nursing@Ovid, and Google Scholar?were searched for articles published between 2009 and 2018 using the following keywords: Education, Distance, Continuing, Learning, Online, Web-Based, Internet, Dementia, Program Evaluation, Validation Studies, Outcome and Process Assessment Healthcare, Nursing, Assisted Instruction, and Facilitated. The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) and Kirkpatrick?s model for the evaluation of training were used to ensure quality and rigor of the analysis. Results: A total of 46 studies met the inclusion criteria. In total, 14 key features were associated with an effective Web-based learning environment, which enabled the environment to be as follows: self-directed, individualized, interactive, multimodal, flexible, accessible, consistent, cost-effective, measurable with respect to participant satisfaction, equitable, facilitated, nurturing of critical thinking and reflection, supportive of creating a learning community, and translated into practice. These features were further categorized into five subgroups: applicability, attractiveness, functionality, learner interaction, and implementation into practice. Literature frequently cites Kirkpatrick?s four-level model of evaluation and application in the review of education and training; however, few studies appeared to integrate all four levels of Kirkpatrick?s model. Features were then correlated against the DCC\&TN, with an encouraging connection found between these features and their inclusion within the content and structure of the DCC\&TN. Conclusions: A total of 14 key features were identified that support an effective and functional Web-based learning environment. Few studies incorporated Kirkpatrick?s salient elements of the model?reaction, learning, behavior, and results?in their evaluation and clinical application. It could, therefore, be considered prudent to include Kirkpatrick?s levels of training evaluation within studies of dementia training. There were few studies that evaluated Web-based dementia education programs, with even fewer reporting evidence that Web-based training could increase staff confidence, knowledge, skills, and attitudes toward people with dementia and be sustainable over time. The DCC\&TN appeared to contain the majority of key features and is one of the few programs inclusive of hospital, community, and residential care settings. The 14 key features can potentially enhance and complement future development of online training programs for health sciences education and beyond. The DCC\&TN model could potentially be used as a template for future developers and evaluators of Web-based dementia training.},

	abstract = {Background: Health care practitioners (HPs), in particular general practitioners (GPs), are increasingly adopting Web-based social media platforms for continuing professional development (CPD). As GPs are restricted by time, distance, and demanding workloads, a health virtual community of practice (HVCoP) is an ideal solution to replace face-to-face CPD with Web-based CPD. However, barriers such as time and work schedules may limit participation in an HVCoP. Furthermore, it is difficult to gauge whether GPs engage actively or passively in HVCoP knowledge-acquisition for Web-based CPD, as GPs? competencies are usually measured with pre- and posttests. Objective: This study investigated a method for measuring the engagement features needed for an HVCoP (the Community Fracture Capture [CFC] Learning Hub) for learning and knowledge sharing among GPs for their CPD activity. Methods: A prototype CFC Learning Hub was developed using an Igloo Web-based social media software platform and involved a convenience sample of GPs interested in bone health topics. This Hub, a secure Web-based community site, included 2 key components: an online discussion forum and a knowledge repository (the Knowledge Hub). The discussion forum contained anonymized case studies (contributed by GP participants) and topical discussions (topics that were not case studies). Using 2 complementary tools (Google Analytics and Igloo Statistical Tool), we characterized individual participating GPs? engagement with the Hub. We measured the GP participants? behavior by quantifying the number of online sessions of the participants, activities undertaken within these online sessions, written posts made per learning topic, and their time spent per topic. We calculated time spent in both active and passive engagement for each topic. Results: Seven GPs participated in the CFC Learning Hub HVCoP from September to November 2017. The complementary tools successfully captured the GP participants? engagement in the Hub. GPs were more active in topics in the discussion forum that had direct clinical application as opposed to didactic, evidence-based discussion topics (ie, topical discussions). From our knowledge hub, About Osteoporosis and Prevention were the most engaging topics, whereas shared decision making was the least active topic. Conclusions: We showcased a novel complementary analysis method that allowed us to quantify the CFC Learning Hub?s usage data into (1) sessions, (2) activities, (3) active or passive time spent, and (4) posts made to evaluate the potential engagement features needed for an HVCoP focused on GP participants? CPD process. Our design and evaluation methods for ongoing use and engagement in this Hub may be useful to evaluate future learning and knowledge-sharing projects for GPs and may allow for extension to other HPs? environments. However, owing to the limited number of GP participants in this study, we suggest that further research with a larger cohort should be performed to validate and extend these findings.},

	abstract = {Background: Hematological medicine is a practical discipline that is difficult to study. Problem-based learning (PBL) is an innovative student-centered teaching method wherein students define their own learning objectives from clinically based problems. Considering that WeChat is the most popular communication app in China, we selected it as a new platform for online PBL to reduce the limitations of traditional PBL in hematology teaching.
Objective: This study aims to explore a new pedagogical method called WeChat-PBL, which is based on real micro clinical cases for postgraduates majoring in hematology and to demonstrate its feasibility and acceptability.
Methods: A total of 48 hematological postgraduates and 7 tutors participated in this study. We divided the participants into 7 groups where students can learn theoretical knowledge. After each course, the members of each group were required to complete in-class quizzes. Moreover, the students and tutors were required to fill out periodic (after each class) and overall (after each semester) evaluations.
Results: A total of 8 micro clinical cases were presented in WeChat-PBL. The average quiz score for acute myelogenous leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, multiple myeloma, acute promyelocytic leukemia, and lymphoma were 89.0\%, 86.0\%, 83.4\%, 88.8\%, and 77.5\%, respectively. Periodic evaluations showed that both students and tutors were satisfied with the process of WeChat-PBL. The overall evaluation results showed that WeChat-PBL was able to positively impact the learning experiences of hematological postgraduates.
Conclusions: Our results indicate the feasibility and acceptability of the WeChat-PBL teaching method for postgraduates majoring in hematology.},

	abstract = {Background: Serious games can be a powerful learning tool in higher education. However, the literature indicates that the learning outcome in a serious game depends on the facilitators’ competencies. Although professional facilitators in commercial game-based training have undergone specific instruction, facilitators in higher education cannot rely on such formal instruction, as game facilitation is only an occasional part of their teaching activities.
Objective: This study aimed to address the actual competencies of occasional game facilitators and their perceived competency deficits.
Methods: Having many years of experience as professional and occasional facilitators, we (n=7) defined requirements for the occasional game facilitator using individual reflection and focus discussion. Based on these results, guided interviews were conducted with additional occasional game facilitators (n=4) to check and extend the requirements. Finally, a group of occasional game facilitators (n=30) answered an online questionnaire based on the results of the requirement analysis and existing competency models.
Results: Our review produced the following questions: Which competencies are needed by facilitators and what are their training needs? What do current training courses for occasional game facilitators in higher education look like? How do the competencies of occasional game facilitators differ from other competencies required in higher education? The key findings of our analysis are that a mix of managerial and technical competencies is required for facilitating serious games in higher educational contexts. Further, there is a limited or no general competence model for game facilitators, and casual game facilitators rarely undergo any specific, formal training.
Conclusions: The results identified the competencies that game facilitators require and a demand for specific formal training. Thus, the study contributes to the further development of a competency model for game facilitators and enhances the efficiency of serious games.},

	abstract = {Background: Teaching medical ultrasound has increased in popularity in medical schools with hands-on workshops as an essential part of teaching. However, the lockdown due to COVID-19 kept medical schools from conducting these workshops.
Objective: The aim of this paper is to describe an alternative method used by our medical school to allow our students to acquire the essential psychomotor skills to produce ultrasound images.
Methods: Our students took online ultrasound courses. Consequently, they had to practice ultrasound exercises on a virtual simulator, using the mouse of their computer to control a simulated transducer. Our team measured the precision reached at the completion of simulation exercises. Before and after completion of the courses and simulator’s exercises, students had to complete a questionnaire dedicated to psychomotor skills. A general evaluation questionnaire was also submitted.
Results: A total of 193 students returned the precourse questionnaire. A total of 184 performed all the simulator exercises and 181 answered the postcourse questionnaire. Of the 180 general evaluation questionnaires that were sent out, 136 (76\%) were returned. The average precourse score was 4.23 (SD 2.14). After exercising, the average postcourse score was 6.36 (SD 1.82), with a significant improvement (P{\textless}.001). The postcourse score was related to the accuracy with which the simulator exercises were performed (Spearman rho 0.2664; P{\textless}.001). Nearly two-thirds (n=84, 62.6\%) of the students said they enjoyed working on the simulator. A total of 79 (58.0\%) students felt that they had achieved the course’s objective of reproducing ultrasound images. Inadequate connection speed had been a problem for 40.2\% (n=54) of students.
Conclusions: The integration of an online simulator for the practical learning of ultrasound in remote learning situations has allowed for substantial acquisitions in the psychomotor field of ultrasound diagnosis. Despite the absence of workshops, the students were able to learn and practice how to handle an ultrasound probe to reproduce standard images. This study enhances the value of online programs in medical education, even for practical skills.},

	abstract = {Background: Medical postgraduates’ demand for data capabilities is growing, as biomedical research becomes more data driven, integrative, and computational. In the context of the application of big data in health and medicine, the integration of data mining skills into postgraduate medical education becomes important.
Objective: This study aimed to demonstrate the design and implementation of a medical data mining course for medical postgraduates with diverse backgrounds in a medical school.
Methods: We developed a medical data mining course called “Practical Techniques of Medical Data Mining” for postgraduate medical education and taught the course online at Peking Union Medical College (PUMC). To identify the background knowledge, programming skills, and expectations of targeted learners, we conducted a web-based questionnaire survey. After determining the instructional methods to be used in the course, three technical platforms—Rain Classroom, Tencent Meeting, and WeChat—were chosen for online teaching. A medical data mining platform called Medical Data Mining - R Programming Hub (MedHub) was developed for self-learning, which could support the development and comprehensive testing of data mining algorithms. Finally, we carried out a postcourse survey and a case study to demonstrate that our online course could accommodate a diverse group of medical students with a wide range of academic backgrounds and programming experience.
Results: In total, 200 postgraduates from 30 disciplines participated in the precourse survey. Based on the analysis of students’ characteristics and expectations, we designed an optimized course structured into nine logical teaching units (one 4-hour unit per week for 9 weeks). The course covered basic knowledge of R programming, machine learning models, clinical data mining, and omics data mining, among other topics, as well as diversified health care analysis scenarios. Finally, this 9-week course was successfully implemented in an online format from May to July in the spring semester of 2020 at PUMC. A total of 6 faculty members and 317 students participated in the course. Postcourse survey data showed that our course was considered to be very practical (83/83, 100\% indicated “very positive” or “positive”), and MedHub received the best feedback, both in function (80/83, 96\% chose “satisfied”) and teaching effect (80/83, 96\% chose “satisfied”). The case study showed that our course was able to fill the gap between student expectations and learning outcomes.
Conclusions: We developed content for a data mining course, with online instructional methods to accommodate the diversified characteristics of students. Our optimized course could improve the data mining skills of medical students with a wide range of academic backgrounds and programming experience.},

	abstract = {Background: Virtual supervisory relationships provide an infrastructure for flexible learning, global accessibility, and outreach, connecting individuals worldwide. The surge in web-based educational activities in recent years provides an opportunity to understand the attributes of an effective supervisor-student or mentor-student relationship.
Objective: The aim of this study is to compare the published literature (through a critical review) with our collective experiences (using small-scale appreciative inquiry [AI]) in an effort to structure and identify the dilemmas and opportunities for virtual supervisory and mentoring relationships, both in terms of stakeholder attributes and skills as well as providing instructional recommendations to enhance virtual learning.
Methods: A critical review of the literature was conducted followed by an AI of reflections by the authors. The AI questions were derived from the 4D AI framework.
Results: Despite the multitude of differences between face-to-face and web-based supervision and mentoring, four key dilemmas seem to influence the experiences of stakeholders involved in virtual learning: informal discourses and approachability of mentors; effective virtual communication strategies; authenticity, trust, and work ethics; and sense of self and cultural considerations.
Conclusions: Virtual mentorship or supervision can be as equally rewarding as an in-person relationship. However, its successful implementation requires active acknowledgment of learners’ needs and careful consideration to develop effective and mutually beneficial student-educator relationships.},

	abstract = {Background: Case-based learning (CBL) typically involves face-to-face interaction in small collaborative groups with a focus on self-directed study. To our knowledge, no published studies report an evaluation of Web conferencing in CBL. Objective: The primary aim of this study was to explore student perceptions and attitudes in response to a remote-online case-based learning (RO-CBL) experience. Methods: This study took place over a 2-week period in 2013 at Monash University, Victoria, Australia. A third year cohort (n=73) of physiotherapy students was invited to participate. Students were required to participate in 2 training sessions, followed by RO-CBL across 2 sessions. The primary outcome of interest was the student feedback on the quality of the learning experience during RO-CBL participation. This was explored with a focus group and a survey. Results: Most students (68/73) completed the postintervention survey (nonparticipation rate 8\%). RO-CBL was generally well received by participants, with 59\% (40/68) of participates stating that they?d like RO-CBL to be used in the future and 78\% (53/68) of participants believing they could meet the CBL?s learning objectives via RO-CBL. The 4 key themes relevant to student response to RO-CBL that emerged from the focus groups and open-ended questions on the postintervention survey were how RO-CBL compared to expectations, key benefits of RO-CBL including flexibility and time and cost savings, communication challenges in the online environment compared to face-to-face, and implications of moving to an online platform. Conclusions: Web conferencing may be a suitable medium for students to participate in CBL. Participants were satisfied with the learning activity and felt they could meet the CBL?s learning objectives. Further study should evaluate Web conferencing CBL across an entire semester in regard to student satisfaction, perceived depth of learning, and learning outcomes.},

	abstract = {Background: The provision of online educational courses has soared since the creation of the World Wide Web, with most universities offering some degree of distance-based programs. The social constructivist pedagogy is widely accepted as the framework to provide education, but it largely relies on the face-to-face presence of students and faculty to foster a learning environment. The concern with online courses is that this physical interaction is removed, and therefore learning may be diminished. Objective: The Community of Inquiry (CoI) is a framework designed to support the educational experience of such courses. This study aims to examine the characteristics of the CoI across the whole of an entirely online master?s course. Methods: This research used a case study method, using a convergent parallel design to study the interactions described by the CoI model in an online master?s program. The MSc program studied is a postgraduate medical degree for doctors or allied health professionals. Different data sources were used to corroborate this dataset including content analysis of both asynchronous and synchronous discussion forums. Results: This study found that a CoI can be created within the different learning activities of the course. The discussion forums integral to online courses are a rich source of interaction, with the ability to promote social interaction, teaching presence, and cognitive learning. Conclusions: The results show that meaningful interaction between faculty and student can be achieved in online courses, which is important to ensure deep learning and reflection.},

Objective: This study aims to demonstrate the feasibility and acceptability of online PBL using WeChat (WeChat-PBL) in a dental practical clerkship. Methods: A total of 72 students in a dental practical clerkship and 10 tutors participated in this study from June to August 2017. We created 10 WeChat groups to provide a communication platform for the PBL teaching, in which the students selected the PBL cases themselves from their practical clerkship. After each individual PBL case, group members were required to complete an evaluation on the PBL process itself. A final questionnaire survey was completed by the participants to summarize the long-term evaluation of the whole WeChat-PBL experience after the 3-month clerkship. Data from the PBL cases, WeChat messages, periodic evaluations, and long-term evaluations were collected for analysis. Results: There were 45 cases presented in the WeChat-PBL within the 3-month clerkship. All students had positive reactions to the communication within the PBL groups. The results of the periodic evaluation showed that the students and tutors were quite satisfied with the process of WeChat-PBL and appreciated the group members? contributions and performance. The final questionnaire results indicated that the WeChat-PBL had achieved positive effects.

A student-created wiki was established to serve as a repository of study tools for students in a medical school curriculum. There is a scarcity of information describing student-led creation of wikis in medical education. Objective: The aim is to characterize website traffic of a student-created wiki and evaluate student perceptions of usage via a short anonymous online survey. Methods: Website analytics were used to track visitation statistics to the wiki and a survey was distributed to assess ease of use, interest in contributing to the wiki, and suggestions for improvement. Results: Site traffic data indicated high usage, with a mean of 315 (SD 241) pageviews per day from July 2011 to March 2013 and 74,317 total user sessions. The mean session duration was 1.94 (SD 1.39) minutes. Comparing Fall 2011 to Fall 2012 sessions revealed a large increase in returning visitors (from 12,397 to 20,544, 65.7\%) and sessions via mobile devices (831 to 1560, 87.7\%). The survey received 164 responses; 88.0\% (162/184) were aware of the wiki at the time of the survey. On average, respondents felt that the wiki was more useful in the preclinical years (mean 2.73, SD 1.25) than in the clinical years (mean 1.88, SD 1.12; P{\textless}.001). Perceived usefulness correlated with the percent of studying for which the respondent used electronic resources (Spearman ?=.414, P{\textless}.001). Conclusions: Overall, the wiki was a highly utilized, although informal, part of the curriculum with much room for improvement and future exploration.},

	abstract = {Background: Imaging and its optimal use are imperative to the practice of medicine, yet many students don?t receive a formal education in radiology. Concurrently, students look for ways to take time away from medical school for residency interviewing. Web-based instruction provides an opportunity to combine these imperatives using online modalities. Objective: A largely Web-based course in radiology during the 4th year of medical school was evaluated both for its acceptance to students who needed to be away from campus for interviews, and its effectiveness on a nationally administered standardized test. Methods: All students were placed into a structured program utilizing online videos, online modules, online textbook assignments, and live interactive online lectures. Over half of the course could be completed away from campus. The Alliance of Medical Student Educators in Radiology test exam bank was used as a final exam to evaluate medical knowledge. Results: Positive student feedback included the freedom to travel for interviews, hands-on ultrasound training, interactive teaching sessions, and quality Web-based learning modules. Negative feedback included taking quizzes in-person, a perceived outdated online textbook, and physically shadowing hospital technicians. Most students elected to take the course during the interview months of October through January. The Alliance of Medical Student Educators in Radiology final exam results (70.5\%) were not significantly different than the national cohort (70\%) who took the course in-person. Test scores from students taking the course during interview travel months were not significantly different from students who took the course before (P=.30) or after (P=.34) the interview season. Conclusions: Students desire to learn radiology and often choose to do so when they need to be away from campus during the fall of their 4th year of study to accomplish their residency interviews. Web-based education in radiology allows students? interview traveling and radiology course objectives to be successfully met without adversely affecting the outcomes on a nationally normed examination in radiology. A curriculum that includes online content and live Web-based teleconference access to faculty can accomplish both imperatives.},

	abstract = {Background: Training health care professionals is associated with increased capacity to deliver evidence-based smoking cessation interventions and increased quit rates among their patients. Online training programs hold promise to provide training but questions remain regarding the quality and usability of available programs. Objective: The aim was to assess the quality of English-language online courses in tobacco dependence treatment using a validated instrument. Methods: An environmental scan was conducted using the Google search engine to identify available online tobacco dependence treatment courses. The identified courses were then evaluated using the Peer Review Rubric for Online Learning, which was selected based on its ability to evaluate instructional design. It also has clear and concise criteria descriptions to ensure uniformity of evaluations by trained experts. Results: A total of 39 courses were identified, of which 24 unique courses were assessed based on their accessibility and functionality during the period of evaluation. Overall, the course ratings indicated that 17 of 24 courses evaluated failed to meet minimal quality standards and none of the courses evaluated could be ranked as superior. However, many excelled in providing effective navigation, course rationale, and content. Many were weak in the use of instructional design elements, such as teaching effectiveness, learning strategies, instructor?s role, and assessment and evaluation. Evaluation results and suggestions for improvement were shared with course administrators. Conclusions: Based on the courses evaluated in this review, course developers are encouraged to employ best practices in instructional design, such as cohesiveness of material, linearity of design, practice exercises, problem solving, and ongoing evaluation to improve existing courses and in the design of new online learning opportunities.},

	abstract = {Background: Web-based learning is becoming an increasingly important instructional tool in nursing education. Multimedia advancements offer the potential for creating authentic nursing activities for developing nursing competency in clinical practice. Objective: This study aims to describe the design, development, and evaluation of an interactive multimedia Web-based simulation for developing nurses? competencies in acute nursing care. Methods: Authentic nursing activities were developed in a Web-based simulation using a variety of instructional strategies including animation video, multimedia instructional material, virtual patients, and online quizzes. A randomized controlled study was conducted on 67 registered nurses who were recruited from the general ward units of an acute care tertiary hospital. Following a baseline evaluation of all participants? clinical performance in a simulated clinical setting, the experimental group received 3 hours of Web-based simulation and completed a survey to evaluate their perceptions of the program. All participants were re-tested for their clinical performances using a validated tool. Results: The clinical performance posttest scores of the experimental group improved significantly (P{\textless}.001) from the pretest scores after the Web-based simulation. In addition, compared to the control group, the experimental group had significantly higher clinical performance posttest scores (P{\textless}.001) after controlling the pretest scores. The participants from the experimental group were satisfied with their learning experience and gave positive ratings for the quality of the Web-based simulation. Themes emerging from the comments about the most valuable aspects of the Web-based simulation include relevance to practice, instructional strategies, and fostering problem solving. Conclusions: Engaging in authentic nursing activities using interactive multimedia Web-based simulation can enhance nurses? competencies in acute care. Web-based simulations provide a promising educational tool in institutions where large groups of nurses need to be trained in acute nursing care and accessibility to repetitive training is essential for achieving long-term retention of clinical competency.},

	doi = {10.2196/jmir.3933},
	abstract = {Background: Virtual patients are interactive computer simulations that are increasingly used as learning activities in modern health care education, especially in teaching clinical decision making. A key challenge is how to retrieve and repurpose virtual patients as unique types of educational resources between different platforms because of the lack of standardized content-retrieving and repurposing mechanisms. Semantic Web technologies provide the capability, through structured information, for easy retrieval, reuse, repurposing, and exchange of virtual patients between different systems. Objective: An attempt to address this challenge has been made through the mEducator Best Practice Network, which provisioned frameworks for the discovery, retrieval, sharing, and reuse of medical educational resources. We have extended the OpenLabyrinth virtual patient authoring and deployment platform to facilitate the repurposing and retrieval of existing virtual patient material. Methods: A standalone Web distribution and Web interface, which contains an extension for the OpenLabyrinth virtual patient authoring system, was implemented. This extension was designed to semantically annotate virtual patients to facilitate intelligent searches, complex queries, and easy exchange between institutions. The OpenLabyrinth extension enables OpenLabyrinth authors to integrate and share virtual patient case metadata within the mEducator3.0 network. Evaluation included 3 successive steps: (1) expert reviews; (2) evaluation of the ability of health care professionals and medical students to create, share, and exchange virtual patients through specific scenarios in extended OpenLabyrinth (OLabX); and (3) evaluation of the repurposed learning objects that emerged from the procedure. Results: We evaluated 30 repurposed virtual patient cases. The evaluation, with a total of 98 participants, demonstrated the system?s main strength: the core repurposing capacity. The extensive metadata schema presentation facilitated user exploration and filtering of resources. Usability weaknesses were primarily related to standard computer applications? ease of use provisions. Most evaluators provided positive feedback regarding educational experiences on both content and system usability. Evaluation results replicated across several independent evaluation events. Conclusions: The OpenLabyrinth extension, as part of the semantic mEducator3.0 approach, is a virtual patient sharing approach that builds on a collection of Semantic Web services and federates existing sources of clinical and educational data. It is an effective sharing tool for virtual patients and has been merged into the next version of the app (OpenLabyrinth 3.3). Such tool extensions may enhance the medical education arsenal with capacities of creating simulation/game-based learning episodes, massive open online courses, curricular transformations, and a future robust infrastructure for enabling mobile learning.},

Limited time is available to reflect on and discuss clinical experiences, policies, or research with others on the involved team. Online resources, such as webcasts and blogs, offer an accessible platform for emergency shift workers to engage in interprofessional discussion and education. Objective: Our objective was to explore the current opportunities for shared learning and discussion and to discover the potential of online resources to foster and facilitate interprofessional education within an academic tertiary emergency department community. Methods: A qualitative study using semistructured interviews was conducted to solicit participants? views of the current culture of IPE in the ED, the potential value of introducing new online resources and technology in support of IPE, and possible barriers to uptake. Participation was voluntary and participants provided verbal informed consent. Results: Online resources discussed included webcasts, interactive discussion forums, websites, and dashboard with links to central repositories. Identified barriers to uptake of new online resources were an unwillingness to ?work? off-shift, a dislike of static one-directional communication, concerns with confidentiality, and the suggestion that new resources would be used by only a select few. Conclusions: Owing to the sensitive dynamics of emergency medicine?and the preference among its professional staff to foster interprofessional discussion and education through personal engagement, in an unhurried, non-stressful environment?introducing and investing in online resources should be undertaken with caution.},

	abstract = {Background: Three-dimensional virtual worlds are becoming very popular among educators in the medical field. Virtual clinics and patients are already used for case study and role play in both undergraduate and continuing education levels. Dental education can also take advantage of the virtual world?s pedagogical features in order to give students the opportunity to interact with virtual patients (VPs) and practice in treatment planning. Objective: The objective of this study was to design and evaluate a virtual patient as a supplemental teaching tool for pediatric dentistry. Methods: A child VP, called Erietta, was created by utilizing the programming and building tools that online virtual worlds offer. The case is about an eight-year old girl visiting the dentist with her mother for the first time. Communication techniques such as Tell-Show-Do and parents? interference management were the basic elements of the educational scenario on which the VP was based. An evaluation of the simulation was made by 103 dental students in their fourth year of study. Two groups were formed: an experimental group which was exposed to the simulation (n=52) and a control group which did not receive the simulation (n=51). At the end, both groups were asked to complete a knowledge questionnaire and the results were compared. Results: A statistically significant difference between the two groups was found by applying a t test for independent samples (P{\textless}.001), showing a positive learning effect from the VP. The majority of the participants evaluated the aspects of the simulation very positively while 69\% (36/52) of the simulation group expressed their preference for using this module as an additional teaching tool. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that a pediatric dentistry VP built in a virtual world offers significant learning potential when used as a supplement to the traditional teaching techniques.},

	abstract = {Background: Microlearning, the acquisition of knowledge or skills in the form of small units, is endorsed by health professions educators as a means of facilitating student learning, training, and continuing education, but it is difficult to define in terms of its features and outcomes. Objective: This review aimed to conduct a systematic search of the literature on microlearning in health professions education to identify key concepts, characterize microlearning as an educational strategy, and evaluate pedagogical outcomes experienced by health professions students. Methods: A scoping review was performed using the bibliographic databases PubMed (MEDLINE), CINAHL, Education Resources Information Center, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Education Full Text (HW Wilson), and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global. A combination of keywords and subject headings related to microlearning, electronic learning, or just-in-time learning combined with health professions education was used. No date limits were placed on the search, but inclusion was limited to materials published in English. Pedagogical outcomes were evaluated according to the 4-level Kirkpatrick model. Results: A total of 3096 references were retrieved, of which 17 articles were selected after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Articles that met the criteria were published between 2011 and 2018, and their authors were from a range of countries, including the United States, China, India, Australia, Canada, Iran, Netherlands, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom. The 17 studies reviewed included various health-related disciplines, such as medicine, nursing, pharmacy, dentistry, and allied health. Although microlearning appeared in a variety of subject areas, different technologies, such as podcast, short messaging service, microblogging, and social networking service, were also used. On the basis of Buchem and Hamelmann?s 10 microlearning concepts, each study satisfied at least 40\% of the characteristics, whereas all studies featured concepts of maximum time spent less than 15 min as well as content aggregation. According to our assessment of each article using the Kirkpatrick model, 94\% (16/17) assessed student reactions to the microlearning (level 1), 82\% (14/17) evaluated knowledge or skill acquisition (level 2), 29\% (5/17) measured the effect of the microlearning on student behavior (level 3), and no studies were found at the highest level. Conclusions: Microlearning as an educational strategy has demonstrated a positive effect on the knowledge and confidence of health professions students in performing procedures, retaining knowledge, studying, and engaging in collaborative learning. However, downsides to microlearning include pedagogical discomfort, technology inequalities, and privacy concerns. Future research should look at higher-level outcomes, including benefits to patients or practice changes. The findings of this scoping review will inform education researchers, faculty, and academic administrators on the application of microlearning, pinpoint gaps in the literature, and help identify opportunities for instructional designers and subject matter experts to improve course content in didactic and clinical settings.},

	abstract = {Background: The introduction of Web-based education and open universities has seen an increase in access to professional development within the health professional education marketplace. Economic efficiencies of Web-based education and traditional face-to-face educational approaches have not been compared under randomized controlled trial conditions. Objective: To compare costs and effects of Web-based and face-to-face short courses in falls prevention education for health professionals. Methods: We designed two short courses to improve the clinical performance of health professionals in exercise prescription for falls prevention. One was developed for delivery in face-to-face mode and the other for online learning. Data were collected on learning outcomes including participation, satisfaction, knowledge acquisition, and change in practice, and combined with costs, savings, and benefits, to enable a break-even analysis from the perspective of the provider, cost-effectiveness analysis from the perspective of the health service, and cost-benefit analysis from the perspective of the participant. Results: Face-to-face and Web-based delivery modalities produced comparable outcomes for participation, satisfaction, knowledge acquisition, and change in practice. Break-even analysis identified the Web-based educational approach to be robustly superior to face-to-face education, requiring a lower number of enrollments for the program to reach its break-even point. Cost-effectiveness analyses from the perspective of the health service and cost-benefit analysis from the perspective of the participant favored face-to-face education, although the outcomes were contingent on the sensitivity analysis applied (eg, the fee structure used). Conclusions: The Web-based educational approach was clearly more efficient from the perspective of the education provider. In the presence of relatively equivocal results for comparisons from other stakeholder perspectives, it is likely that providers would prefer to deliver education via a Web-based medium.

	abstract = {Background: Conversational agents, also known as chatbots, are computer programs designed to simulate human text or verbal conversations. They are increasingly used in a range of fields, including health care. By enabling better accessibility, personalization, and efficiency, conversational agents have the potential to improve patient care. Objective: This study aimed to review the current applications, gaps, and challenges in the literature on conversational agents in health care and provide recommendations for their future research, design, and application. Methods: We performed a scoping review. A broad literature search was performed in MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online; Ovid), EMBASE (Excerpta Medica database; Ovid), PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Central with the search terms ?conversational agents,? ?conversational AI,? ?chatbots,? and associated synonyms. We also searched the gray literature using sources such as the OCLC (Online Computer Library Center) WorldCat database and ResearchGate in April 2019. Reference lists of relevant articles were checked for further articles. Screening and data extraction were performed in parallel by 2 reviewers. The included evidence was analyzed narratively by employing the principles of thematic analysis. Results: The literature search yielded 47 study reports (45 articles and 2 ongoing clinical trials) that matched the inclusion criteria. The identified conversational agents were largely delivered via smartphone apps (n=23) and used free text only as the main input (n=19) and output (n=30) modality. Case studies describing chatbot development (n=18) were the most prevalent, and only 11 randomized controlled trials were identified. The 3 most commonly reported conversational agent applications in the literature were treatment and monitoring, health care service support, and patient education. Conclusions: The literature on conversational agents in health care is largely descriptive and aimed at treatment and monitoring and health service support. It mostly reports on text-based, artificial intelligence?driven, and smartphone app?delivered conversational agents. There is an urgent need for a robust evaluation of diverse health care conversational agents? formats, focusing on their acceptability, safety, and effectiveness.},

	abstract = {Zusammenfassung
            
              Hintergrund
              Die radiologische Anatomie ist in vielen Ländern kein integraler Bestandteil des Medizinstudiums. Die Radiologie scheint für neue online-basierte Lehrmethoden besonders geeignet.
            
            
              Ziel der Arbeit
              Das Ziel dieser Studie ist es, die Eignung des E‑Learnings zur Einführung komplexer Lerninhalte, wie der CT-Anatomie (radiologische Anatomie in der Computertomographie), zu prüfen und zu prüfen, ob die Identifikation wichtiger anatomischer Normvarianten durch Medizinstudent(inn)en durch eine Computertomographie-Checkliste verbessert werden kann.
            
            
              Material und Methoden
              Medizinstudierende wurden gebeten, Computertomographien (CT) der Nasennebenhöhlen auf anatomische Normvarianten vor und nach der Einführung der CLOSE-Kriterien (cribriform plate = Lamina cribrosa, Lamina papyracea, Onodi-Zelle = Sphenoethmoidale Zelle, sphenoid sinus = Keilbeinhöhle, ethmoidal artery = Arteria ethmoidalis anterior) zu untersuchen. Sowohl die CT-Anatomie als auch die CLOSE-Kriterien wurden mittels E‑Learning vermittelt. Die Rate der korrekt identifizierten Normvarianten und die Ergebnisse für die einzelnen CLOSE-Items wurden ermittelt. Die subjektive Evaluation des Nutzens der Checkliste und des E‑Learnings erfolgte mithilfe eines Fragebogens.
            
            
              Ergebnisse
              Zehn Studierende nahmen an dieser Pilotstudie teil. Die Rate der korrekt identifizierten anatomischen Normvarianten verbesserte sich nach der Einführung der CLOSE-Kriterien signifikant von 33,3 auf 61,1 \%. Die Analyse der einzelnen CLOSE-Items zeigte eine signifikante Verbesserung für C, S und E. Die subjektive Evaluation des E‑Learnings und der CT-Checkliste waren sehr positiv.
            
            
              Schlussfolgerung
              Komplexe Lerninhalte können Medizinstudierenden mittels E‑Learning vermittelt werden, auch wenn bisher kein Vorwissen in diesem Bereich besteht. Das E‑Learning wird als angemessene Methode zur Einführung der Thematik beurteilt. Ein strukturiertes Vorgehen mithilfe der CLOSE-Kriterien kann die Erkennung anatomischer Normvarianten signifikant verbessern.

            Abstract
            
              Background
              Computed tomography (CT) anatomy is not an integral part of undergraduate medical training in many countries. Radiology seems to be well suited for new online-based teaching methods.
            
            
              Objective
              The aim of this study was to evaluate whether e‑learning is appropriate for introducing complex learning contents such as sinus CT anatomy to novices and to assess whether identification of relevant anatomical variants in sinus CT scans by medical students can be improved with a sinus CT checklist.
            
            
              Materials and methods
              Medical students were asked to assess sinus CT scans for anatomical variants before and after implementation of the CLOSE mnemonic (cribriform plate, lamina papyracea, Onodi cell, sphenoid sinus pneumatization, and [anterior] ethmoidal artery). Sinus CT anatomy and the CLOSE mnemonic were introduced by e‑learning. The rate of correctly identified variants and the results of the individual CLOSE items were recorded. A questionnaire was distributed for subjective evaluation of the usefulness of the checklist and e‑learning.
            
            
              Results
              Ten students took part in this pilot study. The rate of correctly identified variants improved significantly, from 33.3 to 61.1\%. The analysis of the individual CLOSE items showed a significant improvement for C, S, and E. The subjective evaluation of the CLOSE mnemonic and e‑learning was very positive.
            
            
              Conclusion
              E‑learning was able to transfer complex learning contents in previously non-trained medical students and was evaluated as an appropriate introduction to the topics. Structured assessment of paranasal sinus CT scans using the CLOSE criteria can significantly improve the recognition of anatomical variants.},

Our findings indicate that team-level architectural knowledge mediates the relationship between managerial coaching skill and team performance when the managers' learning goal orientation is high rather than low.

	abstract = {Background Due to the decentralized distribution of family medicine teaching practices in Thuringia and against the background of the SARS-CoV-2-restrictions, the academic teaching of students during the practical year was complemented by a blended learning (BL) format in order to enable time- and location-independent learning. BL refers to the combination of classroom and synchronous or asynchronous online learning situations. This article describes the development, implementation and evaluation of an accompanying seminar in the BL-format.
Methods The didactic concept was based on the constructive alignment. To achieve the learning objectives, the approach of case-based learning was chosen. In the initial online-phase, a corresponding learning environment with a virtual case was created. In different folder levels, students found a welcome field, organizational information, and the patient record with a link to the virtual work platform where assignments were completed. In the subsequent presence-phase, knowledge was secured via mc questions and the aspects resulting from the assignments were processed and discussed.
Results The course reached a total of nine medical students in their practical year. A cardiovascular clinical case was chosen for the vignette. In addition to evaluating an ECG, cardiovascular risk scores were to be calculated, laboratory values interpreted, and medication suggestions provided. The sequence was designed in such a way that the students, guided by questions, elaborate the workflow of a family physician in a structured way. In the presence-phase, the acquired knowledge is secured and discussed. Overall, the majority of the nine students agreed with the positively formulated statements on the digital learning environment.
Conclusions The described BL-module proved to be suitable to bring casebased learning into a digital framework, to further use the advantages of face-to-face teaching and to respond to the decentralized distribution of teaching practices in family medicine in Thuringia.},

In a randomized experimental field study, medical students (n = 82) attended either regular face-­to-­face classes of the microscopic anatomy course or the same practical course online using Zoom videoconferencing platform. The present study investigated Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and salivary cortisol concentration as stress correlates, within the contexts of online and face-­to-­face learning and compared these parameters with a control group that was measured at rest. Additionally, participants completed a standardized questionnaire about their experienced emotions in relation to task achievement and subjective stress levels. A significant reduction in HRV was found in face-­to-­face learning, suggesting stronger stress responses in the face-­to-­face learning environment (η2 = 0.421, p {\textless} 0.001). Furthermore, participants engaged in face-­to-­face learning showed significantly higher cortisol concentrations (η2 = 0.115, p = 0.032). Additionally, increased sympathetic activation correlated with the discrete positive emotion of enjoyment exclusively within the face-­to-­face condition (r = 0.365, p = 0.043). These results indicate that the transfer of a face-­to-­face practical course in microscopic anatomy to an online learning environment is associated with decreased sympathetic and enhanced vagal cardiovascular influences, together with lower cortisol concentrations in healthy medical students.},

	abstract = {The Covid-­19 pandemic has changed almost all aspects of education. The anatomy and histology courses for pharmacy students focus heavily on the face-­to-­face communication of theory and practical knowledge, and due to the pandemic, only theory content was delivered in an online format. This brought up many concerns about pharmacy student preparedness. This work explores the effectiveness and student perspective of remote teaching of the theoretical anatomy and histology course in Jordanian universities from the perspective of pharmacy students. The objectives are to determine the strengths, challenges, and the effectiveness of remote delivery on student learning. An online-b­ ased validated questionnaire was distributed to students majoring in Pharmacy and enrolled in the course during the second semester of 2019–­ 2020 at 11 universities in Jordan. A total of 442 students participated in the study. Results showed that there were significant differences in perceptions of the social media platforms used in distance learning and remote delivery of the course. Most participants had positive perceptions of the educational process and studying via distance learning. There were many strengths noted including time flexibility and several challenges such as the lack of face-­to-­face interaction with instructors, inadequate internet connectivity, and technical issues. In conclusion, online-­taught anatomy and histology course during the Covid-­19 lockdown in Jordan was a success as perceived by students, but the course still possessed challenges need to be overcome in the future.},

Prompts led to more reflections on feelings and activity planning in the learning journal, and better reflections on feelings and analyses. Prompts also promoted conceptual knowledge about reflection and application of reflective knowledge.},

Allerdings sind nun Übungen und deren Lösungen online abrufbar. Bei früheren Auflagen gab es ein separates Übungsbuch. Die Autorin, die weitere Titel in der Dummies-Reihe veröffentlicht hat, vermittelt allgemein verständlich und anhand vieler alltäglicher Beispiele Basiswissen zur Statistik, vor allem zur deskriptiven Statistik. Sie zeigt auf, wie Statistiken richtig gelesen und interpretiert werden können. Ganz ohne höhere Mathematik kommt auch sie nicht aus. Wer das Buch sinnvoll nutzen möchte, sollte schon solide mathematische Kenntnisse besitzen, z.B. Summenformeln kennen und auch Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung verstehen. Der Titel ist als 1. Einführung wie das Lehrbuch von Günter Buttler in vielen Bibliotheken denkbar. Die Autorin hat auch eine Fortsetzung geschrieben "Statistik II für Dummies" bzw.

	abstract = {Interprofessional education is a key component of preparing health professional students to become collaborative practice-ready gradu­ ates. In the design and delivery of activities, educators seek ways to enhance student participation and learning with the goal of devel­ oping students’ collaborative practice capabilities. Traditionally, learning formats have largely maintained a clinical focus to enable students to learn with, from and about each other’s roles as health professionals. In recent years, escape rooms have emerged as an innovative teaching approach within interprofessional education. Utilising gamification, escape rooms require students to work colla­ boratively, employing teamwork, communication, conflict resolution and problem-solving skills to ‘escape’ a set scenario. This article explores our experience of using escape rooms as an interprofes­ sional education strategy. Additionally, we report on trialling a nonclinical focus within the activity as an alternative means of educating students for collaborative practice.},

Research shows that a signiﬁcant number of young people fall victim to hateful speech online. Unfortunately, such content is often poorly controlled by online platforms, leaving users to mitigate the problem by themselves. It’s possible that Machine Learning and browser extensions could be used to identify hateful content and assist users in reducing their exposure to hate speech online. A proof-of-concept extension was developed for the Google Chrome web browser, using both a local word blocker and a cloud-based model, to explore how effective browser extensions could be in identifying and managing exposure to hateful speech online. The extension was evaluated by 124 participants regarding the usability and functionality of the extension, to gauge the feasibility of this approach. Users responded positively on the usability of the extension, as well as giving feedback regarding where the proof-of-concept could be improved. The research demonstrates the potential for a browser extension aimed at average users to reduce individuals’ exposure to hateful speech online, using both word blocking and cloud-based Machine Learning techniques.},

The thematic analysis progressed from description to a deeper understanding, searching for manifest and latent patterns across the data. The COREQ checklist was used for reporting the study.
Results: The analysis resulted in one overarching theme: ‘To walk the critical care nursing pathway –­balancing competency, time, and challenges to become proficient’. The subthemes were ‘expectations, obligations, and workload in unknown environments’, ‘constantly assessing while being assessed’, ‘continuous precepting and challenges’, ‘vulnerability and commitment’ and ‘thriving in the role, mastering new skills’. The study provides valuable insights into a complex learning environment and the importance of caring aspects for trainees during their critical care nursing education.
Conclusion: Precepting, continuous competence assessment and clear learning outcomes are necessary to create a safe environment for the trainees during their development.},

	abstract = {Background: Psychosis, including schizophrenia, is the most common severe mental illness affecting 1\% of the population worldwide. A large number of people provide long-term support and care for a relative with psychosis. Although psychoeducational interventions, especially those delivered through a face-to-face group format, have an established evidence base for improving the caregiving experience, well-being, and health outcomes, large-scale implementation and access remain limited. There is a demand for such provision to be made through the internet for greater flexibility and wider access.
Objective: This study aimed to integrate participatory research methodologies by the public, patients, and carers into the eHealth (electronic health) intervention design and build process to improve the product’s usability and acceptability.
Methods: We adapted a structured eHealth intervention build method to include participatory research activities involving key stakeholders and end users to co-design and coproduce our intervention. An expert advisory group (EAG) comprising public involvement members led the formative design and build work using an agile build process. Carers independent from the study were consulted on the evolving drafts of the intervention prototype through focus group meetings. These results were fed back into the intervention build work continuously to ensure end users’ input inform every stage of the process.
Results: An EAG comprising individuals with lived experience of psychosis, carers, health care professionals, researchers, voluntary organization workers, and eLearning experts (n=14) was established. A total of 4 coproduction workshops were held over 1 year during which the alpha and beta prototypes were designed and built through the participatory research work. Alongside this, 2 rounds of focus group study with carers (n=24, in 4 groups) were conducted to seek consultation on end users’ views and ideas to optimize the intervention design and usability. Finally, the EAG carried out a Web-based walk-through exercise on the intervention prototype and further refined it to make it ready for an online usability test. The final product contains multiple sections providing information on psychosis and related caregiving topics and interactive discussion forums with experts and peers for psychosocial support. It provides psychoeducation and psychosocial support for carers through the internet, promoting flexible access and individualized choices of information and support.
Conclusions: The participatory research work led to the coproduction of a eHealth intervention called COPe-support (Carers fOr People with Psychosis e-support). We believe the study methodology, results, and output have optimized the intervention design and usability, fitting the end users’ needs and usage pattern. COPe-support is currently being tested for its effectiveness in promoting carers’ health outcome through an online randomized controlled trial.},

	abstract = {The article describes the features of distance learning for foreign citizens based on methodological tactics for submitting language material, implemented in online courses for the initial stage. Taking into account the fact that in conditions of non-contact learning and outside the linguistic environment it is much more difﬁcult to transfer to students new linguistic knowledge associated with the cultural characteristics of native speakers, their value orientations and world-view, the authors aim to ﬁnd such methods that will satisfy the needs of a modern educational institution, in which foreign citizens are also trained. To implement the goal set in the work, a range of issues is designated, focusing on the methodological features of the introduction of linguistic material at all language levels. In the course of the study, it is concluded that the ﬁlling of each lesson should correspond to the principle of authenticity and be structured: have a direction of assimilation from phoneme to syntaxes. This implies the creation of such teaching aids in the software system, which will include minimized material, organized according to the principle of complexity and eccentricity, sustained in lexical and grammatical dosage (for example, the introduction of exercises aimed not only at observing and ﬁxing linguistic phenomena, but also to create conditions for their communicative implementation).},

However, there is still wide variability both between, and within countries regarding the amount of training delivered using VR, particularly in relation to intensive care medicine
Objectives: To identify the range of uses, phase of development and effectiveness of VR for intensive care unit (ICU) staff training.
Methods: The review followed the scoping review framework set out by Levac et al. (2010). A multi-database search was undertaken. All study types were included if they explored the use of VR for intensive care staff (ICU) staff training. Full paper screening, data extraction and assessment of bias was carried out by a single reviewer with verification by a second reviewer. A narrative synthesis was chosen to summarize the data.
Results: The search strategy identified 647 records. Following the removal of duplicates, screening of titles, abstracts and full texts, five studies were included. VR for ICU training has primarily focused on skill acquisition for surgical procedures. The majority of studies in this area were classified to be at an early stage of assessing acceptability, tolerability and efficacy. There was very low-quality evidence that VR for ICU training is effective.
Conclusions: Studies have explored the use of VR for a small number of surgical procedures and emergency patient scenarios. VR for ICU training demonstrates some potential, however further development and high-quality research is required. Research relating to virtual reality for ICU staff training is currently of weak methodological quality and as such, no recommendations to clinical practise can be made. Wherever possible when using VR for ICU staff training it should be utilized as part of a high-quality study.},

In this study, we propose a novel method to programmatically measure young learners’ ABP practices in open-ended programming contexts with a 4-stage model. We present results from the online community of Turtle Universe, a new version of NetLogo designed for mobile platforms and younger learners in informal contexts. We draw on a dataset of 2,300 block-based and text-based projects shared by out-of-school, unsupervised learners. Our approach generally succeeded in measuring learners’ openended ABP practices. Differences were found among projects of different stages and modalities. We discuss the implications of our approach and design of block-based ABP environments.},

The study’s goal was to assess the student’s views of E-assessment quiz when utilized as part of a larger plan to support the subject’s overall teaching and learning. Students were required to engage in prior reading, watch an online lecture video, and then participate in an online quiz and a self-directed survey questionnaire soliciting their views. The high value students place on the usage of E-assessment quizzes in course instruction was also indicated by a survey that was completed at the conclusion of the e-quiz course. The outcomes of the pilot research employing online quizzes demonstrate that these assessments have a demonstrably favorable impact on students’ engagement, motivation, self-reﬂection. This study was of importance since assessment in the medical science ﬁeld impacts, the qualiﬁcation accreditation with the regulatory authorities; the qualiﬁcation throughput rates; the reputation of the university which impacts the future employability of its medical laboratory science graduates; and the government funding allocated to the university. Furthermore, this work has implications in the medical education pedagogical practice and forms a foundation for future works on this subject.},

For many, this greatly differs from how they used to learn before and even though technology is incremental to students’ everyday life, many are not familiar with using technology for their learning. The purpose of this study was to investigate if first-year college students are prepared for learning with technology and to empirically document possible gaps. To assess this, two successive first year cohorts completed a 32-items questionnaire that was based on standardized scales to assess time management, collaboration, and self-directedness, as the three core competencies for higher education learners to successfully engage in learning with technology. The answers were related to students’ prior experiences and their motivation to learn online. First results indicated that time management is a major challenge for first-year students with and without work experience. Results also suggest that the motivation to learn has a positive relationship with the concept variables chosen to assess first-year students’ expectation and readiness for online learning. The findings may support the need for higher education institutions to understand students’ expectations and selfassessed readiness and to identify areas for improvement.},

Despite years of extensive pedagogical research, learning sign language remains a formidable task, with the majority of the current systems relying extensively on online learning resources, presuming that users would regularly access them; yet, this approach can feel monotonous and repetitious. Recently, gamiﬁcation has been proposed as a solution to the problem, however, the research focus is on game design, rather than user experience design. In this work, we present a system for user-deﬁned interaction for learning static American Sign Language (ASL), supporting gesture recognition for user experience design, and enabling users to actively learn through involvement with user-deﬁned gestures, rather than just passively absorbing knowledge. Early ﬁndings from a questionnaire-based survey show that users are more motivated to learn static ASL through user-deﬁned interactions.},

As the name implies, alert generation is intended to be the purpose of an EWS. However, the proposed systems don’t go beyond the early prediction of at-risk of failure learners and don’t suggest automatic methods to generate alerts. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that automatically generates early and accurate alerts for teachers of atrisk of failure learners. This algorithm uses both an original concept of alert rule to deﬁne the alerting method and temporal evaluation metrics to identify the reliable starting time for generating alerts. As a proof of concept, we apply this algorithm on four diﬀerent EWS using real data of k-12 learners enrolled in online learning courses.},

This requires considering their individual goals to improve learning eﬃciency on one side and on the other to provide tasks with an appropriate diﬃculty for the particular person. Apparently, this is not a trivial issue, and various approaches have been investigated in the areas of adaptive assessment and dynamic diﬃculty adjustment. Here, we present a solution for the domain of mathematics that rests on two pillars: Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Item Response Theory (IRT). Speciﬁcally, we investigated the eﬀectiveness of two RL algorithms in recommending mathematical tasks to a sample of 125 ﬁrst-year Bachelor’s students of computer science. Our recommendation was based on the Estimated Total Score (ETS) and item diﬃculty estimates derived from IRT. The results suggest that this method allowed for personalized and adaptive recommendations of items within the user-selected threshold while avoiding those with an already achieved target score. Experiments were performed on a real data set to demonstrate the potential of this approach in domains where task performance can be rigorously measured.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses a three-level model that synthesizes and unifies existing learning theories to model the roles of artificial intelligence (AI) in promoting learning processes. The model, drawn from developmental psychology, computational biology, instructional design, cognitive science, complexity and sociocultural theory, includes a causal learning mechanism that explains how learning occurs and works across micro, meso and macro levels. The model also explains how information gained through learning is aggregated, or brought together, as well as dissipated, or released and used within and across the levels. Fourteen roles for AI in education are proposed, aligned with the model's features: four roles at the individual or micro level, four roles at the meso level of teams and knowledge communities and six roles at the macro level of cultural historical activity. Implications for research and practice, evaluation criteria and a discussion of limitations are included. Armed with the proposed model, AI developers can focus their work with learning designers, researchers and practitioners to leverage the proposed roles to improve individual learning, team performance and building knowledge communities. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Numerous learning theories exist with significant cross-over of concepts, duplication and redundancy in terms and structure that offer partial explanations of learning. Frameworks concerning learning have been offered from several disciplines such as psychology, biology and computer science but have rarely been integrated or unified. Rethinking learning theory for the age of artificial intelligence (AI) is needed to incorporate computational resources and capabilities into both theory and educational practices. What this paper adds A three-level theory (ie, micro, meso and macro) of learning that synthesizes and unifies existing theories is proposed to enhance computational modelling and further develop the roles of AI in education. A causal model of learning is defined, drawing from developmental psychology, computational biology, instructional design, cognitive science and sociocultural theory, which explains how learning occurs and works across the levels. The model explains how information gained through learning is aggregated, or brought together, as well as dissipated, or released and used within and across the levels. Fourteen roles for AI in education are aligned with the model's features: four roles at the individual or micro level, four roles at the meso level of teams and knowledge communities and six roles at the macro level of cultural historical activity. Implications for practice and policy Researchers may benefit from referring to the new theory to situate their work as part of a larger context of the evolution and complexity of individual and organizational learning and learning systems. Mechanisms newly discovered and explained by future researchers may be better understood as contributions to a common framework unifying the scientific understanding of learning theory.},

The respondents of the quantitative study consisted of 331 ESL undergraduates from a public university. A four-part questionnaire was distributed via online. The 5-Likert scale survey instrument was extracted from Aderibigbe (2021) to reveal the association of cognitive, social and teaching presence in online group work. The findings from the study in general show a significantly strong relationship between all three types of presence during online group work. Statistics obtained from the questionnaire indicated impactful roles played by the presence of the three elements during online group work. Majority of the students collectively agree that the presence of cognitive, social and teacher presence have a positive role on their learning experience during online group work. This can provide insights for future educators, researchers as well as students on the importance of understanding the core elements needed during online group work; hence, improving the quality and productivity.},

Results show that students reported less improvement in team-member eﬀectiveness, lower psychological safety, and less satisfaction in the semester with the emergency transition. However, students also reported lower conﬂict. The most important factor predicting project grades shifted from ‘Interacting with teammates’ to ‘Having relevant knowledge, skills, and abilities’ amid the emergency shift, accompanied by a reduction in team interdependence.

	abstract = {In collocated collaboration, group members frequently compare, discuss, and decide on ideas or partial solutions to reach an overall goal. To facilitate comparison, documentation as well as votes of the outcomes of such discussions, we apply mobile phones using mobile devicebased interaction techniques. Such interaction techniques provide eyesfree and easy input without interacting with the screen content directly. We present three mobile device-based interactions for direct voting in collaborative scenarios, namely Order, Shift, and Turn. In an online user survey with 30 participants, we investigated the proposed interactions concerning their usability and UX aspects as well as their suitability for collocated collaborative voting. We found that they are overall easy to use and playful which leads to a positive UX. Especially Order was assessed as clear and simple interaction technique. We received additional feedback that helps us to improve the proposed interactions further to support collocated collaboration extensively.},

The analysis showed that in the early stages of the class, the amount of preparation for preclass learning was found by many groups to contribute to a better assessment of class activities and artifacts. However, as the class progressed and students became more familiar with the class, the diﬀerence in the amount of pre-class learning preparation and the amount of class activities between the high and low-scoring groups disappeared, suggesting that there was a diﬀerence in the activities during the group work itself.},

	abstract = {During COVID-19, universities across the globe experienced a rapid requirement to move to online learning and teaching provision. This rapid move has been explored as emergency remote education (ERE). This paper reviews and presents some emerging literature regarding ERE, demonstrating how this created an environment where technology-mediated abuse could arise within the university context. Intentional and unintentional forms of technology-mediated abuse, within a global context, are considered with account of how intersectional characteristics can impact. The paper concludes with a set of provocations explored within an example framework. The provocations are given to situate ways of thinking which are facilitative of safer and more respectful use of technological spaces. Both the provocations and example framework aim to be useful critical tools for program and module teams to adapt in higher education institutions within the online sphere. The phenomenon of ERE is an opportunity to consider what can be learned with regard to management of technology-mediated abuse. However, a focus on ERE presents limitations in the paper because of the smaller number of academic sources at this time, due to recency of the COVID-19 pandemic.},

Effective learning not only requires suitable tasks but also their meaningful usage within the student’s learning process. So far, learning processes of students working on such Self-Assessment tasks have not been studied. Thus, SAFRAN was extended with activity logging allowing process mining. SAFRAN was used in a first-year computer science university course. Students' behavior was clustered and analyzed using log data. 3 task completion behavior patterns were identified indicating positive, neutral or negative impact on task processing. Differences in the use of feedback and sample solutions were also identified. The results are particularly relevant for instructors who can tailor adaptive feedback content better to its target group. The analytics approach described may be useful for researchers who want to implement and study adaptive and personalized task processing support.},

	abstract = {Self-regulation of learning in programming has been extensively investigated, emphasising an individual’s metacognitive and motivational regulation components. However, learning often happens in socially situated contexts, and little emphasis has been paid to studying social modes of regulation in programming. We designed Thyone, a collaborative Jupyter Notebook extension to support learners’ programming regulation in an online classroom context with the overall aim to foster their intrinsic motivation toward programming. Thyone’s salient features - Flowchart, Discuss and Share Cell - incorporate affordances for learners to co-regulate their learning and drive their motivation. In an exploratory quasi-experimental study, we investigated learners’ engagement with Thyone’s features and assessed its influence on their learning motivation in an introductory programming course. We found that Thyone facilitated the co-regulation of programming learning and that the users’ engagement with Thyone appeared to positively influence components of their motivation: interest, autonomy, and relatedness. Our results inform the design of technological interventions to support co-regulation in programming learning.

                Artificial intelligence (AI) can enhance teachers' capabilities by sharing control over different parts of learning activities. This is especially true for complex learning activities, such as dynamic learning transitions where students move between individual and collaborative learning in un‐planned ways, as the need arises. Yet, few initiatives have emerged considering how shared responsibility between teachers and AI can support learning and how teachers' voices might be included to inform design decisions. The goal of our article is twofold. First, we describe a secondary analysis of our co‐design process comprising six design methods to understand how teachers conceptualise sharing control with an AI co‐orchestration tool, called
                Pair‐Up
                . We worked with 76 middle school math teachers, each taking part in one to three methods, to create a co‐orchestration tool that supports dynamic combinations of individual and collaborative learning using two AI‐based tutoring systems. We leveraged qualitative content analysis to examine teachers' views about sharing control with
                Pair‐Up
                , and we describe high‐level insights about the human‐AI interaction, including control, trust, responsibility, efficiency, and accuracy. Secondly, we use our results as an example showcasing how human‐centred learning analytics can be applied to the design of human‐AI technologies and share reflections for human‐AI technology designers regarding the methods that might be fruitful to elicit teacher feedback and ideas. Our findings illustrate the design of a novel co‐orchestration tool to facilitate the transitions between individual and collaborative learning and highlight considerations and reflections for designers of similar systems.

                        Artificial Intelligence (AI) can help teachers facilitate complex classroom activities, such as having students move between individual and collaborative learning in unplanned ways.
                      
                      
                        Designers should use human‐centred design approaches to give teachers a voice in deciding what AI might do in the classroom and if or how they want to share control with it.

                        Presents teacher views about how they want to share control with AI to support students moving between individual and collaborative learning.

                        We share five implications for designers that teachers highlighted as necessary when designing AI‐features, including control, trust, responsibility, efficiency and accuracy.

Firstly, we present a process for the conversion of a faceto-face facilitated design workshop into a SCOW using a method we call the “playboard” which draws on concepts from CSCL literature. Secondly, we evaluate the efficacy of SCOWs using an iterative evaluation with 75 participants, including measures for participant satisfaction, subjective and objective learning outcomes, quality of the online and self-guided experience, and comparison with face-to-face workshops. Results across all measures indicate that the self-guided workshop was as successful as the in-person facilitated original. Moreover, participants reported advantages of the more scalable format including improved access to those with non-visible disabilities and in the Global South. Finally, based on our findings, we present a set of recommendations for others interested in using SCOWs as an inclusive and scalable way to support collaborative experiences.},

In addition to participation in in-service training and professional development courses, this process also includes the use of informal learning opportunities which exist outside of organized events in everyday professional life, and which are mostly initiated by the teachers themselves. This study focuses on the ﬁeld of continuing professional development of teachers, which has been little researched so far. Based on a quantitative questionnaire survey of a representative sample of N = 405 teachers from Germany, we applied structural equation models to analyze the factorial structure and the use of informal learning opportunities, as well as their personal and school-related determinants. The ﬁndings indicate predictive effects of teachers’ demographic and dispositional characteristics (age, gender, lack of traditional qualiﬁcation, self-efﬁcacy), but also of job characteristics (extended area of responsibility) on the use of informal learning opportunities. Furthermore, indications pointed to the necessity of differentiating print and online media regarding reception behavior. The role of informal learning opportunities in the context of the teachers’ overall professionalization is discussed.},

This study investigated the impact of using breakout rooms in group discussions on students’ expe­ rience of relatedness and intrinsic motivation. An experimental study with undergraduate students (N = 108) showed that the use of breakout rooms during group discussions resulted in higher satis­ faction of students’ need for social relatedness and higher intrinsic motivation compared to using plenary discussions. As expected, the positive effect of the use of breakout rooms on students’ in­ trinsic motivation was partially mediated by the satisfaction of students’ need for social relatedness. Practical implications, as well as limitations of the study, are discussed.},

	abstract = {The goal of opponent modeling is to model the opponent policy to maximize the reward of the main agent. Most prior works fail to eﬀectively handle scenarios where opponent information is limited. To this end, we propose a Limited Information Opponent Modeling (LIOM) approach that extracts opponent policy representations across episodes using only self-observations. LIOM introduces a novel policy-based data augmentation method that extracts opponent policy representations oﬄine via contrastive learning and incorporates them as additional inputs for training a general response policy. During online testing, LIOM dynamically responds to opponent policies by extracting opponent policy representations from recent historical trajectory data and combining them with the general policy. Moreover, LIOM ensures a lower bound on expected rewards through a balance between conservative and exploitation. Experimental results demonstrate that LIOM is able to accurately extract opponent policy representations even when the opponent’s information is limited, and has a certain degree of generalization ability for unknown policies, outperforming existing opponent modeling algorithms.},

	abstract = {Students’ challenges in introductory programming courses have long been subject to research. In fact, learners are faced with cognitively complex tasks, such as modeling and writing programs. At the same time, educators are known to experience challenges with the classiﬁcation of a competency’s cognitive complexity. In this paper, we present a text dataset with competency goals expected in basic programming courses. We then apply a deep learning approach to the dataset to classify the competency-based learning objectives as a use case. A manually annotated dataset of 35 German universities and their learning objectives in 129 introductory programming courses was processed into a machinereadable format to achieve these goals. It contains 1015 competency goals (both in German and English) and their classiﬁcation into dimensions of complexity. Diﬀerent state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) models, e.g., BERT, along with Natural Language Processing techniques, i.e., parts-of-speech-tagging, were combined to train a deep learning model in a supervised manner for the classiﬁcation of competencies. The proofof-concept shows that knowledge can be derived from the dataset. In the presented use case, the ML classiﬁcation achieved a maximum accuracy of 81.4\%. This work has several implications for educators, as it is the foundation for an application that classiﬁes competency goals according to their cognitive complexity. The dataset can further be used to test language models as a baseline performance task. Moreover, the dataset can be extended, e.g., with data from other countries and languages. The dataset is available online under a Creative Commons license (https:// github.com/nkiesler-cs/HEPComp-Dataset).},

	abstract = {Fingerprint localization based on Channel State Information (CSI) plays a crucial role in indoor location-based services. Due to the natural compatibility between oﬄine training and online localization of CSI-based ﬁngerprint localization and deep learning, recent studies have shown that introducing the latest deep learning techniques can provide higher localization accuracy. Most current research eﬀorts in localization have focused on leveraging deep learning advancements to enhance performance. However, these approaches typically rely on complex techniques and large model sizes, prioritizing model-driven methods over practicality and real-world deployment capabilities. In this paper, we aim to improve the localization performance of simple, general-purpose models (e.g., ResNet) through data-driven training paradigms, which align with the value proposition of real-world applications. Speciﬁcally, by constructing positive examples with diﬀerent signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) for contrastive learning, ResNet can learn SNR-robust representations. Furthermore, we focus on antenna instances (physical components of CSI) at a smaller granularity to learn scale-invariant representations through hierarchical loss. In the ﬁnal location regression ﬁne-tuning process, only a pooling layer and a fully connected layer need to be added to perform position mapping. Experiments on real-world indoor and urban canyon datasets demonstrate that our method achieves positioning accuracies of 0.16 m and 0.54 m, respectively, signiﬁcantly outperforms stateof-the-art baseline models.},

It is a common method to use manually marked anchors or anchors inferred through autonomous learning as supervisory information to guide the prediction of subsequent anchor links. However, the credibility of the anchor is not discussed. In this paper, to address this problem, we propose a new framework that can simultaneously complete the identiﬁcation of trusted anchors and the prediction of anchor links across social networks under a uniﬁed framework. The proposed method can eﬀectively identify non-trusted anchor links and improve the accuracy of the anchor link prediction model through the reconstruction of trusted anchors. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two large-scale real-life social networks. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art models with a big margin.},

	abstract = {Self-directed learning and self-assessment require student respon­ sibility over learning needs, goals, processes, and outcomes. However, this student-led learning can be challenging to achieve in a classroom limited by a one-to-many teacher-led instruction. We, thus, have designed and prototyped a generative artificial intelligence chatbot application (GAIA), named TeacherGAIA, that can be used to asynchronously support students in their selfdirected learning and self-assessment outside the classroom. We first identified diverse constructivist learning approaches that align with, and promote, student-led learning. These included knowl­ edge construction, inquiry-based learning, self-assessment, and peer teaching. The in-context learning abilities of large language model (LLM) from OpenAI were then leveraged via prompt engi­ neering to steer interactions supporting these different learning approaches. These interactions contrasted with ChatGPT, OpenAI’s chatbot which by default engaged in the traditional transmissionist mode of learning reminiscent of teacher-led instruction. Preliminary design, prompt engineering and prototyping suggested fidelity to the learning approaches, cognitive guidance, and social-emotional support, all of which were implemented in a generative AI manner without pre-specified rules or “hard-coding”. Other affordances of TeacherGAIA are discussed and future development outlined. We anticipate TeacherGAIA to be a useful application for teachers in facilitating self-directed learning and self-assessment among K-12 students.},

	abstract = {Background: Enabling teaching approaches that promote active learning can require a certain amount of organisational reorienta­ tion. For example, structural and cultural shifts may be needed to accommodate moves towards student-centred learning. In higher education environments, lecturers can play a significant role in supporting students’ collaborative learning. More needs to be understood about the connections between lecturers’ pedagogical approaches and the enhancement of student learning through group-based activities.
Purpose: With the context of a journey towards active learning in mind, this qualitative study sought to explore the relationship between lecturers’ pedagogical approaches and students’ groupbased learning, and consider how student learning may be enriched through collaborative activities.
Method: Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with 12 lecturers who were teaching a range of subjects in a higher education institution in Malaysia. Observations of teaching were also undertaken. Data were analysed thematically. Findings: The in-depth analysis of rich data identified the many different ways in which lecturers enabled and promoted students’ group-based learning, through the design and delivery of appro­ priate and engaging collaborative tasks. Some challenges in the journey towards active learning development were identified in terms of supportive and procedural information provision.
Conclusion: Findings offer insight into how group activities may enhance student learning, when supported with carefully designed learning tasks which help students acquire the necessary collabora­ tive skills. More broadly, they also highlight the need for institu­ tional professional development support for higher education lecturers in order to engender a sustained culture of collaborative teaching and learning.},

              Hintergrund
              Das Ankommen auf der Intensivstation ist für Fachkräfte entscheidend, um hochqualitative Patient:innenversorgung gewährleisten zu können. Dieser Prozess hängt von der Einarbeitungsqualität ab.
            
            
              Ziel der Arbeit
              Ziel der Arbeit ist die Erfassung von Art und Umfang der Einarbeitung und der Zufriedenheit von jungen Fachkräften auf der Intensivstation.
            
            
              Material und Methoden
              In einer anonymen, berufsgruppenübergreifenden Onlineumfrage wurde die Einarbeitungsstruktur sowie Zufriedenheit untersucht.
            
            
              Ergebnisse
              Von 554 Teilnehmenden kamen etwa zwei Drittel aus dem ärztlichen Bereich. Während bei der Pflege 59 \% ein schriftliches Einarbeitungskonzept aufwiesen, lag ein solches nur bei 27 \% der Ärzt:innen vor. Pflegefachpersonen gaben im Median 30 Tage als Einarbeitungszeit, Ärzt:innen 7 Tage an. Ein Drittel der Pflegefachpersonen stimmte der Aussage zu, ausreichend durch die Einarbeitung auf die intensivmedizinische Tätigkeit vorbereitet worden zu sein. Im ärztlichen Bereich fühlten sich nur 17 \% der Teilnehmenden ausreichend durch die Einarbeitung vorbereitet. Mehr als 42 \% der Befragten konnten sich vorstellen, noch länger als 3 Jahre in der Intensivmedizin tätig zu sein.
            
            
              Diskussion
              Evidenzbasierte Methoden zur Strukturierung der Einarbeitung von neuen Fachkräften sind in deutschen Intensivstationen nur gering verbreitet. Die Einarbeitungszeit liegt weit unter publizierten Empfehlungen. Auch wenn bezüglich der materiellen und personellen Ausstattung Defizite wahrgenommen werden, geben die meisten Befragten Zufriedenheit mit Lernzuwachs und interprofessioneller Zusammenarbeit an.

            Abstract
            
              Background
              Onboarding of junior staff in the intensive care unit is vital to ensure high-quality critical care treatment. This process depends on beginner’s training.
            
            
              Aim
              We aimed to determine structure and duration of intensive care onboarding and the job satisfaction of junior professionals in German intensive care units.
            
            
              Materials and methods
              We conducted an anonymous, interprofessional online survey regarding quality of onboarding and job satisfaction among young professionals.
            
            
              Results
              A total of 554 young professionals participated, about two thirds were physicians. A written concept was used in 59\% of the nurse’s and 27\% of physicians’ training. Median duration of training before taking full charge of patient treatment was 30 days among nurses and 7 days among physicians. About one third of nurses and 17\% of physicians stated that they were sufficiently prepared after the training period, whereby 49\% of physicians often felt overwhelmed. More than 42\% can imagine working in critical care longer than the next 3 years.
            
            
              Conclusion
              Fundamental methods for training of critical care professionals starting their intensive care career are underused in Germany and the duration of training blatantly differs from national guideline recommendations. Although there seem to be deficits concerning material and staff resources, participants are satisfied with learning progress and teamwork.},

The model presented has two dimensions: a) the complexity of teams, ranging from single team to networks of teams, and b) the complexity of interdisciplinarity, ranging from disciplinary projects to broad interdisciplinary projects. This results in the identiﬁcation of six diﬀerent project types. This typology can be used as a conceptual framework for interdisciplinary learning throughout engineering education. The project types embrace both single-team projects and larger projects consisting of multiple teams working together on complex problems.},

	abstract = {This study examined the affordances of an online learning platform used in a Chinese university for online teaching and learning during the pandemic period. A usefulness theoretical perspective was adopted to examine three types of affordances of the platform, namely, educational affordances, social affordances, and technological affordances. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected and analyzed, including survey questionnaires, observation, and semi-structured interviews. A range of educational affordances emerged from the results, including Representation, Resource sharing, Community-building, Promoting interaction, and Administration. However, despite the respondents’ perceived ease of use of the platform, results indicate that the platform played a limited role in increasing learners’ social presence. A framework for examining usefulness has been developed based on the results. Pedagogical implications are proposed and suggestions for future research are provided.},

	abstract = {Currently, in Latvia, the improvement of the education process at the political and practical levels is based on the approach of the school as a learning organization, without critically analysing the advantages and disadvantages of the approach. Therefore, the aim of this theoretical study is to evaluate a different theoretical approach - the school as a learning organization and a learning culture to explore the practices taking place at school and to influence them by implementing changes in education. The analysis of the theoretical sources, documents and studies carried out in the research allows to conclude that the approach of the school as a learning organization, although it is widely used, does not sufficiently explain the processes taking place at school, ignoring the interaction of various structures and agents and the power given to them. Educational research is increasingly recognizing the pervasive influence of culture on teaching and learning. From a cultural perspective, changes in education and practices at schools is a complex and not always feasible process, as it is associated with tensions and conflicts. Using the theory of learning culture, it is possible to understand why students learn or do not engage in the learning process, why teachers change or do not change their practices, and how management can influence developments at a particular school. The study demonstrates the possibilities of the theoretical approaches of both sides to find out and improve the teaching and learning implemented at schools on the way to the knowledge society.},

Analysis of pre- and post-surveys showed that the participants hold more constructivist conceptions about teaching and learning after attending KBPD. The classroom reflection artefacts showed that they were more inclined to apply the KB principles in their own classes, and that they regarded the epistemological role of their students have shifted more towards knowledge constructors/creators in their classrooms after attending the KBPD.

Study 1 explored how sixteen students read, evaluate, and use feedback for revision. Results revealed three feedback processing strategies: (1) superficial processing (n = 6), which is characterized by reading feedback in a linear way, without critically rereading or revising the text, (2) local processing (n = 6) in which students switched between reading the comments and the commented text, and (3) deep processing (n = 4) in which students integrated the feedback with both commented and uncommented parts of the text and made more substantial revisions. In Study 2, we investigated the local and deep feedback reading strategy in more detail with 41 stu­ dents using a within-subject design with different types of feedback. Results demonstrated the same strategies among students, but also that the focus of feedback affected students’ revision behavior, above and beyond an individual feedback processing strategy. This finding is in line with previous research that emphasized the effects of feedback characteristics on students’ use of feedback. By triangulating various process measures, this research is one of the first that provides empirical evidence for different feedback processing strategies among students. These novel insights in individual feedback engagement processing can be used to extend and refine current theories on how, when, and why feedback works and for whom.},

A total of 398 (132 male and 266 female) students from a comprehensive university in China participated in questionnaire survey and reported on their perceived online learning environments, learners’ empowerment, learning behavioral engagement, and learning motivation. Results showed that online learning environments significantly and positively influenced learners’ empowerment, learning behavioral engagement, and learning motivation; learners’ empowerment is positively associated with learning behavioral engagement. Furthermore, learning motivation mediated the relation between online learning environments and learning behavioral engagement. These findings unraveled the associations of both the external factors (e.g., online learning environments) and the internal factors (e.g., learning motivation; learners’ empowerment) of affecting students’ online learning behavioral engagement, thereby contributing to our further understanding and exploration of the imperatives of the joint inherent and extrinsic driving mechanisms. This study highlighted the importance of constructing appropriate online learning environments in accelerating students’ learning behavioral engagement, and would suggest focusing on teachers’ conscientious behaviors of enhancing the awareness of online learning community and stimulating students’ learning motivation.},

	abstract = {Background  Decreased experiential learning opportunities exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic have increased development of online surgical educational courses. To what extent may such courses provide exposure to broad and accessible surgical education?
Methods  Surge is a 6-week online surgical elective hosted within a virtual learning environment, covering all surgical specialties. Course content is mapped to the Royal College of Surgeons’ Undergraduate Curriculum in Surgery. Each week consultant surgeons discuss their specialty in short videos on anatomy, pathology and lifestyle of a surgeon. Students also engage with learning activities; further reading lists; formative quizzes and live sessions including suturing practice. Participants were medical students undertaking third-year electives at the University of Sheffield. Pre- and post-course questionnaires investigated student interest in surgery, understanding of steps required to pursue a surgical career and confidence in surgical environments. Qualitative data was collected via free-text responses and analysed with content analysis. Quantitative data was collected using 5-point Likert scales (1 = Strongly Disagree; 5 = Strongly Agree) and analysed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.
Results  Twenty-two students participated in Surge over five 6-week cohorts. Examination of free-text responses revealed students gained increased understanding of available surgical career options. Students felt better informed regarding different surgical specialties (median score 2.5 vs. 4, p = 0.000) and steps required to develop a surgical portfolio (median score 2 vs. 5, p = 0.000). Additionally, confidence in understanding of relevant intraoperative steps improved (median score 3 vs. 4, p = 0.000).
Conclusion  These data demonstrate Surge increased student confidence and understanding of surgical careers despite reduced in-person opportunities to engage with surgical education. Surge will continue to be developed and evaluated on a larger scale.},

Adapting different f2f teaching methodologies to online environments is a significant problem that urgently needs attention, particularly in health education.
Methods  This study is part of design-based research and consists of three phases, which comprise design, analysis, and re-design. First, the animation-based problem scenarios were developed, and the learning environment (e-PBL) elements were organized. Then animation-based scenarios and the e-PBL environment were used, and problems related to the use of the environment were determined with an experimental study which was based on a pretestposttest control group design. Finally, we used the following three measurement tools in the data collection process: a scale to determine the effectiveness of PBL, an attitude scale toward PBL, and the Clinical Objective Reasoning Exams (CORE). The study group in this research comprised 92 medical undergraduates (47 female and 45 male).
Results  There were similar scores between the two groups (e-PBL and f2f ) in terms of the effectiveness of the platforms, the attitudes of the medical undergraduates, and the CORE scores. Also, there were positive relationships between the attitude scores, grade point average (GPA), and PBL scores of the undergraduates. Another significant positive relationship was found between the CORE scores and the GPA.
Conclusions  The animation-supported e-PBL environment positively effects the participants’ knowledge, skills, and attitude. Students who have high academic scores attitude positively towards e-PBL. Providing problem scenarios as multimedia animations is the innovative face of the research. They have been produced inexpensively with off-theshelf web-based animation apps. These technological advances may democratize the production of video-based cases in the future. Although the results of this study were obtained before the pandemic, they showed no differences between e-PBL and f2f-PBL in terms of effectiveness.},

	abstract = {Background  Virtual patients provide a safe way to simulate authentic clinical practice. Twine is an open-source software that can be used to create intricate virtual patient games, including elements like non-linear free text history taking and time-related changes to the game’s narrative. We evaluated the incorporation of Twine virtual patient games into a diabetes acute care online learning package for undergraduate medical students at the University of Glassgow, Scotland.
Methods  Three games were developed using Twine, Wacom Intuous Pro, Autodesk SketchBook, Camtasia Studio, and simulated patients. Online material included three VP games, eight microlectures, and a single best answer multiple choice question quiz. The games were evaluated at Kirkpatrick Level 1 with an acceptability and usability questionnaire. The entire online package was evaluated at Kirkpatrick Level 2 with pre- and post-course multiple choice and confidence questions, with statistical analysis performed using paired t-tests.
Results  122 of approximately 270 eligible students provided information on resource utilisation, with 96\% of these students using at least one online resource. 68\% of students who returned surveys used at least one VP game. 73 students provided feedback on the VP games they had played, with the majority of median responses being “agree” on positive usability and acceptability statements. The online resources were associated with a mean multiple choice score increase from 4.37 out of 10 to 7.96 out of 10 (p {\textless} 0.0001, 95\% CI + 2.99 to + 4.20, n = 52) and a mean total confidence score increase from 4.86 out of 10 to 6.70 out of 10 (p {\textless} 0.0001, 95\% CI + 1.37 to + 2.30, n = 48).
Conclusions  Our VP games were well-received by students and promoted engagement with online material. The package of online material led to statistically significant increases in confidence and knowledge in diabetes acute care outcomes. A blueprint with supporting instructions has now been created to facilitate rapid creation of further games using Twine software.},

	abstract = {Background  The availability and correct use of personal protective equipment (PPE) to prevent and control infections plays a critical role in the safety of medical students in clinical placements. This study explored their experiences and perspectives in their final clerkship year with PPE during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Methods  This qualitative study was based on social constructivism and was conducted in 2021 at the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin. In three online focus group discussions, 15 medical students in their final clerkship year reported their experiences with PPE training and use during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were recorded, transcribed and analysed based on Kuckartz’s approach to content analysis. We drew upon the a priori dimensions of the capability, opportunity, motivation - behaviour (COM-B) model as main categories as well as emergent issues raised by the study participants (subcategories).
Results  In addition to the three main categories of the COM-B model, eleven subcategories were identified through inductive analysis. The study participants reported several factors that hindered the correct use of PPE. In the area of capabilities, these factors were related to learning experience with PPE in terms of both theoretical and practical learning together with later supervision in practice. In the area of opportunities, these factors included the limited availability of some PPE components, a lack of time for PPE instruction and supervision and inappropriate role modelling due to the inconsistent use of PPE by physicians and nursing staff. The area of motivation to use PPE was characterized by an ambivalent fear of infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the prioritization of patient safety, i.e., the need to prevent the transmission of the virus to patients.
Conclusions  Our study revealed several limitations pertaining to the enabling factors associated with the trainable behaviour “correct use of PPE”. The concept of shared responsibility for student safety was used to derive recommendations for future improvement specifically for the medical school as an organization, the teachers and supervisors, and students themselves. This study may guide and stimulate other medical schools and faculties to explore and analyse components of student safety in clinical settings in times of infectious pandemics.},

	abstract = {Background  Learning by concordance (LbC) is a recent approach that introduces learners to the complexity and uncertainty of clinical practice. Some data on LbC suggest that it stimulates reflection in future clinicians. We developed an online LbC training program on electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation in general practice at the University of Strasbourg, France, and conducted an exploratory qualitative study to document the impact of this ECG learning-by-concordance training program on reflection in participants.
Methods  We created 18 clinical vignettes on ECG interpretation based on a review of the literature on frequent and serious cardiovascular diseases that can be identified using an ECG in general practice. The training program was delivered online to postgraduate general practice students in two faculties of medicine. We conducted a qualitative study based on thematic analysis of two focus groups and six individual interviews. Inductive and deductive coding were performed. The five major components of reflection in the Nguyen model were used in the deductive coding: (i) thoughts and actions, (ii) attentive, critical, exploratory, and iterative processes (ACEI), (iii) underlying conceptual frame, (iv) change and (v) self.
Results  Two focus groups and six individual interviews were conducted. The qualitative analysis indicated 203 codes in the focus groups and 206 codes in the individual interviews, which were divided into five groups based on the components of reflection in the Nguyen model: (i) the self; (ii) attentive, critical, exploratory, and iterative interactions with (iii) one’s thoughts and actions; and (iv) a view on both the change itself and (v) the underlying conceptual frame. Inductive coding revealed interesting insights into the impact of the identity of the panel members, the absence of a scoring system and the question of uncertainty in ECG reading.
Conclusions  This study supports the claim that the use of LbC in the context of ECG interpretation could foster reflection in future general practitioners. We discuss future research avenues on instructional design of LbC and reflection.},

	abstract = {Background  While serious games seem to be supportive in healthcare education, none of them had been designed to develop competence in diagnosis and treatment planning of oral lesions. Therefore, this research aimed to develop an online simulation-based serious game for training diagnosis and treatment planning of oral lesions (SimOL) and to evaluate its educational impact in terms of knowledge improvement and retention.
Methods  As a mandatory task in an oral lesion course, all 28 students were required to participate in SimOL activities. Participants were instructed to complete a pre-knowledge assessment following a one-week washout period prior to the game activity. Subsequent to the game completion, they were tasked to complete a post-knowledge assessment I (Full score = 15) and satisfaction questionnaire. A post-knowledge assessment II was administered a week later to evaluate knowledge retention.
Results  The findings demonstrated a significant increase in the assessment scores after interacting with the game (P {\textless} 0.001), where the pre- and immediate post-knowledge assessment scores were 8.00 (SD = 2.11) and 11.71 (SD = 2.39), respectively. The game also exhibited a positive impact on knowledge retention, as there was no significant difference between the scores of post-knowledge assessment I and II (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Additionally, students perceived the game as positively in all aspects, although the entertainment aspect achieved a slightly lower score of 3.70 (SD = 0.21), in comparison to the usefulness and ease of use with a score of 4.02 (SD = 0.11) and 4.02 (SD = 0.16), respectively.
Conclusion  SimOL demonstrated its potential as an effective learning tool for improving and retaining knowledge for diagnosis and treatment planning of oral lesions. The game was perceived positively by dental students in all aspects, however further improvements should prioritize the enhancement of entertaining components.},

	abstract = {This study had three primary goals. First, it aimed to craft an intervention program centered around collaborative learning enabled by Padlet. Second, it aimed to gauge the perceptions of health management students regard‑ing this intervention and how it affected their collaborative learning experiences. Additionally, the third objective of the study aimed to investigate how students’ flexible thinking within the learning process might shape their perceptions of the advantages derived from this instructional activity within the domain of online collaborative learning. Data for the analysis were gathered from 100 Israeli undergraduate students by two measurements: Flexible thinking in learning and Student perceptions of collaborative learning via Padlet. The intervention program included several stages. First, the students discussed the pedagogic objective of using Padlet. In the second stage, the students were presented with ill-structured problems related to the course content. Each group had to choose one prob‑lem and analyze it from three perspectives discussed in the course—healthcare provider, patient, and organization. Next, the students presented and explained their solutions employing the shared knowledge base. The final work was presented in different formats using various technologies. The PLS-SEM analysis has corroborated our hypoth‑esis that students’ flexible thinking might positively contribute to their perception of Padlet utilization. According to the empirical model, in general, students who perceived themselves as more flexible were found more receptive to utilizing the proposed technological tool (Padlet) and hence tended to appreciate its function as a collaborative learning platform enabler. This study mainly underscores the important role flexible thinking plays in motivating man‑agers and medical professionals to embrace innovative technologies or methods for teamwork, that could enable them to weigh arguments, seek alternative solutions to authentic problems, and adjust their approaches effectively and collaboratively as new challenges emerge.},

	abstract = {Background  At the Faculty of Medicine of the National University of Malaysia, a virtual patient software program, DxR Clinician, was utilised for the teaching of neurocognitive disorder topics during the psychiatry posting of undergraduate medical students in a modified team-based learning (TBL) module. This study aimed to explore medical students’ learning experiences with virtual patient.
Methods  Ten students who previously underwent the learning module were recruited through purposive sampling. The inclusion criteria were: (a) Fourth-year medical students; and (b) Completed psychiatry posting with the new module. Students who dropped out or were unable to participate in data collection were excluded. Two online focus group discussions (FGDs) with five participants each were conducted by an independent facilitator, guided by a questioning route. The data were transcribed verbatim and coded using the thematic analysis approach to identify themes.
Results  Three main themes of their learning experience were identified: (1) fulfilment of the desired pedagogy (2), realism of the clinical case, and (3) ease of use related to technical settings. The pedagogy theme was further divided into the following subthemes: level of entry for students, flexibility of presentation of content, provision of learning guidance, collaboration with peers, provision of feedback, and assessment of performance. The realism theme had two subthemes: how much the virtual patient experience mimicked an actual patient and how much the case scenario reflected real conditions in the Malaysian context. The technical setting theme entailed two subthemes: access to the software and appearance of the user interface. The study findings are considered in the light of learning formats, pedagogical and learning theories, and technological frameworks.
Conclusions  The findings shed light on both positive and negative aspects of using virtual patients for medical students’ psychiatry posting, which opens room for further improvement of their usage in undergraduate psychiatry education.},

	abstract = {Background: The use of online technologies in health professionals’ education, including physiotherapy, has been advocated as effective and well-accepted tools for enhancing student learning. The aim of this study was to critically review the effectiveness, and user perceptions of online technology for physiotherapy teaching and learning.
Methods: Following databases were systematically searched on the 31st of August 2013 for articles describing implementation of online technologies into physiotherapy teaching and learning: ERIC, CINAHL, Web of Science, Academic search complete, ProQuest Nursing and Allied Health Source, Medline, Embase, and Scopus. No language, design or publishing date restrictions were imposed. Risk of bias was assessed using the 2011 Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool checklist (MMAT).
Results: A total of 4133 articles were retrieved; 22 articles met the inclusion criteria and were accepted for final analysis: 15 on the effectiveness of technology, and 14 on users’ perceptions. Included studies used three designs: case study (14 articles), controlled trial (3), and randomized controlled trial (5). Studies investigated both pre-registration physiotherapy students (1523) and physiotherapy professionals (171). The quality of studies ranged from 67 to 100 \% on the MMAT checklist which can be considered moderate to excellent. More than half of the studies (68 \%) received scores greater than 80 \%. Studies typically investigated websites and discussion boards. The websites are effective in enhancing practical skills performance, and discussion boards in knowledge acquisition, as well as in development of critical and reflective thinking. Students’ perceptions of the use of websites were mostly positive, providing students with entertaining, easy accessible resources. Perceived barriers to the use of websites included difficulties with internet connection, insufficiently interactive material, or personal preference for paper-based materials. Discussion boards were perceived as deepening students’ thinking and facilitating reflection, allowing for learning from multiple perspectives, and providing easy communication and support.
Conclusions: The results of this review suggest that online technologies (i.e., websites and discussion boards) have many benefits to offer for physiotherapy teaching and learning; There was minimal evidence of barriers for the use of online technologies, however, addressing the identified ones could enhance adherence to use of online technologies in health professionals’ education.},

	abstract = {Background:  The COVID-19 pandemic has created unprecedented challenges for medical students and educators worldwide. Groups 1, 2 and 3 of year 3, semester 2 medical students at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (n = 275) had only completed 2, 5 and 7 weeks, respectively, of their scheduled 10-week clinical medicine and surgery attachments, prior to the Irish shutdown of all in-person non-essential activities, including medical student education.
Methods:  We developed and delivered an online case-based program, focused on history-taking skills and clinical reasoning, using simulated patients and video technologies. 12 tutorials were delivered over 6 weeks to 35 subgroups of 8 students in line with program learning outcomes. Both simulated patients (n = 36), and tutors (n = 45, from retired clinical professors to newly graduated physicians), were rapidly upskilled in Blackboard Collaborate and Microsoft Teams, and also in the provision of constructive feedback. We evaluated this newly developed program by the following three criteria: student attendance, achieved grades, and student feedback.
Results:  Attendance at the 12 tutorials was higher amongst group 1 and 2 students (75 and 73\%) by comparison with group 3 students (60\%) (p = {\textless} 0.001). Of the 273 students that sat the Year 3 Semester 2 online long case assessment, 93\% were successful. Despite group 1 students having the least prior clinical experience, results were similar to those of groups 2 and 3 (1st honors, 2nd honors, pass, and fail grades for group 1, 39\%, 33\%, 23\% and 6\%; group 2, 34\%, 41\%, 17\% and 8\%; group 3, 39\%, 25\%, 28\% and 7\%) (p = 0.48). An increased attendance rate at tutorials was associated with higher numbers of honors grades (p = {\textless} 0.001). Anonymous feedback from the students demonstrated considerable satisfaction with program: {\textgreater} 85\% agreed that the online program was interactive and very educational.
Conclusions:  Use of online video technology, tutors of varied experience, and simulated patients were demonstrated to replicate patient encounters, and to facilitate the development of clinical skills remotely during the COVID19 pandemic.},

	abstract = {Background: Online formative assessments have a sound theoretical basis, and are prevalent and popular in higher education settings, but data to establish their educational benefits are lacking. This study attempts to determine whether participation and performance in integrated online formative assessments in the biomedical sciences has measurable effects on learning by junior medical students.
Methods: Students enrolled in Phase 1 (Years 1 and 2) of an undergraduate Medicine program were studied over two consecutive years, 2006 and 2007. In seven consecutive courses, end-ofcourse (EOC) summative examination marks were analysed with respect to the effect of participation and performance in voluntary online formative assessments. Online evaluation surveys were utilized to gather students' perceptions regarding online formative assessments.
Results: Students rated online assessments highly on all measures. Participation in formative assessments had a statistically significant positive relationship with EOC marks in all courses. The mean difference in EOC marks for those who participated in formative assessments ranged from 6.3\% (95\% confidence intervals 1.6 to 11.0; p = 0.009) in Course 5 to 3.2\% (0.2 to 6.2; p = 0.037) in Course 2. For all courses, performance in formative assessments correlated significantly with EOC marks (p {\textless} 0.001 for each course). The variance in EOC marks that could be explained by performance in the formative assessments ranged from 21.8\% in Course 6 to 4.1\% in Course 7.
Conclusion: The results support the contention that well designed formative assessments can have significant positive effects on learning. There is untapped potential for use of formative assessments to assist learning by medical students and postgraduate medical trainees.},

This article describes the development of a CoP that focused on synthesizing and adapting evidence in Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PM\&R). This study aimed to investigate the CoP members’ experiences and perceived barriers and enablers of CoP success in the early phase of a CoP.
Methods: Physical therapists and a physician (n = 10) volunteered for a CoP that synthesized literature of PM\&R evidence. CoP members participated in education and training on critical appraisal and knowledge synthesis, practiced critical appraisal skills, and summarized literature. Three months after CoP initiation, semi-structured interviews were conducted to understand the CoP members’ experiences and reflections. Members also completed an online survey that included the Evidence-Based Practice Confidence scale (EPIC), questions related to CoP activities, and demographics before CoP initiation. We utilized the Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation Model of Behaviour (COM-B) to explore how these experiences related to the behavioral adaptation and participation.
Results: Ten themes related to the potential contributors to CoP success and failure were identified. These included project management, technological solutions, efficacy, organizational support, interaction, the bigger picture, selfdevelopment, time, and motivation.
Conclusions: Contributors to CoP success may include clearly articulated project goals and participant expectations, education and training, reliable technology solutions, organizational support, face-to-face communication, and good project management. Importantly, CoP members need time to participate in activities.},

	abstract = {Background: The learning opportunities for global health professionals have expanded rapidly in recent years. The diverse array of learners and wide range in course quality underscore the need for an improved course vetting process to better match learners with appropriate learning opportunities.
Methods: We developed a framework to assess overall course quality by determining performance across four defined domains Relevance, Engagement, Access, and Pedagogy (REAP). We applied this framework across a learning catalogue developed for participants enrolled in the Sustaining Technical and Analytic Resources (STAR) project, a global health leadership training program.
Results: The STAR learning activities database included a total of 382 courses, workshops, and web-based resources which fulfilled 531 competencies across three levels: core, content, and skill. Relevance: The majority of activities were at an understanding or practicing level across all competency domains (486/531, 91.5\%). Engagement: Many activities lacked any peer engagement (202/531, 38.0\%) and had limited to no faculty engagement (260/531, 49.0\%). Access: The plurality of courses across competencies were offered on demand (227/531, 42.7\%) and were highly flexible in pace (240/531, 45.2\%). Pedagogy: Of the activities that included an assessment, most matched activity learning objectives (217/531, 40.9\%).
Conclusions: Through applying REAP to the STAR project learning catalogue, we found many online activities lacked meaningful engagement with faculty and peers. Further development of structured online activities providing learners with flexibility in access, a range of levels of advancement for content, and opportunities to engage and apply learning are needed for the field of global health.},

	abstract = {Background: As Family Medicine programs across Canada are transitioning into a competency-based curriculum, medical students and clinical teachers are increasingly incorporating tablet computers in their work and educational activities. The purpose of this pilot study was to identify how preceptors and residents use tablet computers to implement and adopt a new family medicine curriculum and to evaluate how they access applications (apps) through their tablet in an effort to support and enhance effective teaching and learning.
Methods: Residents and preceptors (n = 25) from the Family Medicine program working at the Pembroke Regional Hospital in Ontario, Canada, were given iPads and training on how to use the device in clinical teaching and learning activities and how to access the online curriculum. Data regarding the use and perceived contribution of the iPads were collected through surveys and focus groups. This mixed methods research used analysis of survey responses to support the selection of questions for focus groups.
Results: Reported results were categorized into: curriculum and assessment; ease of use; portability; apps and resources; and perceptions about the use of the iPad in teaching/learning setting. Most participants agreed on the importance of accessing curriculum resources through the iPad but recognized that these required enhancements to facilitate use. The iPad was considered to be more useful for activities involving output of information than for input. Participants’ responses regarding the ease of use of mobile technology were heterogeneous due to the diversity of computer proficiency across users. Residents had a slightly more favorable opinion regarding the iPad’s contribution to teaching/learning compared to preceptors.
Conclusions: iPad’s interface should be fully enhanced to allow easy access to online curriculum and its built-in resources. The differences in computer proficiency level among users should be reduced by sharing knowledge through workshops led by more skillful iPad users. To facilitate collection of information through the iPad, the design of electronic data-input forms should consider the participants’ reported negative perceptions towards typing data through mobile devices. Technology deployment projects should gather sufficient evidence from pilot studies in order to guide efforts to adapt resources and infrastructure to relevant needs of Family Medicine teachers and learners.},

	abstract = {Background: Students in biomedical disciplines require understanding of normal and abnormal microscopic appearances of human tissues (histology and histopathology). For this purpose, practical classes in these disciplines typically use virtual microscopy, viewing digitised whole slide images in web browsers. To enhance engagement, tools have been developed to enable individual or collaborative annotation of whole slide images within web browsers. To date, there have been no studies that have critically compared the impact on learning of individual and collaborative annotations on whole slide images.
Methods: Junior and senior students engaged in Pathology practical classes within Medical Science and Medicine programs participated in cross-over trials of individual and collaborative annotation activities. Students’ understanding of microscopic morphology was compared using timed online quizzes, while students’ perceptions of learning were evaluated using an online questionnaire.
Results: For senior medical students, collaborative annotation of whole slide images was superior for understanding key microscopic features when compared to individual annotation; whilst being at least equivalent to individual annotation for junior medical science students. Across cohorts, students agreed that the annotation activities provided a user-friendly learning environment that met their flexible learning needs, improved efficiency, provided useful feedback, and helped them to set learning priorities. Importantly, these activities were also perceived to enhance motivation and improve understanding.
Conclusion: Collaborative annotation improves understanding of microscopic morphology for students with sufficient background understanding of the discipline. These findings have implications for the deployment of annotation activities in biomedical curricula, and potentially for postgraduate training in Anatomical Pathology.},

	abstract = {Background  Case-Based Learning (CBL) in medical education is a teaching approach that engages students as learners through active learning in small, collaborative groups to solve cases from clinical patients. Due to the challenges afforded by the COVID-19 pandemic, small group learning such as CBL, transitioned quickly to include technologyenhanced learning to enable distance delivery, with little information on how to apply pedagogical frameworks and use learning theories to design and deliver online content.
Methods  To extend understanding of online CBL a scoping review protocol following the PRISMA-ScR framework explored the literature that describes the use of online CBL application in medical education and the outcomes, perceptions, and learning theories. A literature search was conducted in January 2022 followed by a subsequent review in October 2022. After peer review using the PRESS guidelines, the CASP appraisal tool was used to assess the rigor of each study design.
Results  The scoping review identified literature published between 2010 and 2022 (n = 13 articles), on online CBL in the field of medical education with 11 observational studies describing student and facilitator perceptions and two randomized controlled studies. Positive perceptions of online learning included a flexible work-life balance, connection with learners, and improved accessibility. Negative experiences of online CBL included poor internet access, a distracting learning environment, and loss of communication. In the studies that collected student performance data, results showed equivalent or improved outcomes compared to the control. The CASP appraisal tool highlighted the deficiencies in most study designs, lack of framework or learning theory, and poor reproducibility of the methods to answer the research questions.
Conclusion  This scoping review identified literature to describe the academic outcomes, and student and facilitator perceptions of online CBL in medical education. However, the CASP tool uncovered deficiencies in study descriptions and design leading to poor quality evidence in this area. The authors provide recommendations for frameworks and learning theories for the future implementation of online CBL.},

	abstract = {Background: Technological advances have driven huge change in educational practices though concerns exist about a lack of evidence informing this change, in particular with social media-based medical education activities. The purpose of this study was to conduct a scoping review of WhatsApp use in medical education, narratively describing how it has been used and evaluated, and the theoretical considerations in relevant articles.
Methods: A modified 5-stage scoping review model was used. We performed 2 searches from February 2009 to February 2019 in EBSCO, SCOPUS, Web of Science, EMBASE, Medline PubMed and Google Scholar) using the term “WhatsApp” in all search fields. A 3-stage process for study selection was performed. Only original articles in English presenting original data about WhatsApp in medical education were included. The Kirkpatrick model of training evaluation was used to describe learning outcomes in included studies.
Results: Twenty-three articles were selected for review. Three strategies for WhatsApp use were apparent; primarily educational use with a pre-defined curriculum (n = 5), primarily educational use without a curriculum (n = 11), and primarily non-educational use (n = 7). Most of the educational studies used an online moderator and were in a local hospital or university department. Studies not primarily educational were national or international and seldom included an online moderator. All 5 studies with a pre-defined curriculum reported Kirkpatrick level 2 learner knowledge outcomes. A majority of the remaining studies only reported Kirkpatrick level 1 learner attitudes. Seven studies with 647 participants reported an improvement in learners’ knowledge following WhatsApp learning, though methodological weaknesses were apparent. Evidence for underlying learning theory considerations were scant throughout the studies.
Conclusions: WhatsApp is popular and convenient in medical education. Current published literature suggests it may also be effective as a medical learning tool. By combining the 3 strategies for WhatsApp use and the exploration-enactment-assessment integrated learning design framework, we propose an instant messenger design model for medical education. This may address the need for theory-driven instructional design in social media learning. Further research would clarify the role of WhatsApp and our design model in this area.},

	abstract = {Background:  Properly designed and implemented eLearning can lead to improvement of dental teaching quality. Various strategies have been proposed to increase the effectiveness of eLearning in dental education, however, there is a lack of research to assess the effectiveness of these strategies.
Objective:  To investigate dental students’ learning performance and perception of a virtual flipped learning format compared to a virtual traditional learning method.
Methods:  A crossover pilot study was conducted at the College of Dentistry, Princes Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University, Saudi Arabia. Computer-generated randomization, blinded from researchers who analyzed the results, was performed to allocate 32 participants (aged 23.27 ± 0.86 years) to one of two groups. Participants in the control group were taught through the virtual traditional learning method (VTL) using live video lectures. In contrast, participants in the intervention group were taught through the virtual flipped learning method (VFL) using recorded online lectures and post-lecture virtual discussions. Learning gain and preference were measured by pre- and post-test average score differences and a modified validated survey, respectively.
Results:  There was no significant difference in learning performance between VFL and VTL groups (P {\textgreater} 0.05). However, students preferred VFL over VTL and the differences were significant among all survey items, except for the opportunity to ask questions.
Conclusion:  Health professions educators are encouraged to carefully design online curricula with efficient learning strategies that help students improve learning performance and foster self-directed learning skills while valuing active learning in an online environment.

	abstract = {Background: Medical students face many barriers to seeking out professional help for their mental health, including stigma relating to mental illness, and often prefer to seek support and advice from fellow students. Improving medical students’ mental health literacy and abilities to support someone experiencing a mental health problem could reduce barriers to help seeking and improve mental health in this population. Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) is an evidence-based intervention designed to improve mental health literacy and ability to respond to someone with a mental health problem. This pilot randomised controlled trial aims to evaluate the MHFA eLearning course in UK medical students.
Methods: Fifty-five medical students were randomised to receive six weeks access to the MHFA eLearning course (n = 27) or to a no-access control group (n = 28). Both groups completed baseline (pre-randomisation) and follow-up (six weeks post-randomisation) online questionnaires measuring recognition of a mental health problem, mental health first aid intentions, confidence to help a friend experiencing a mental health problem, and stigmatising attitudes. Course feedback was gathered at follow-up.
Results: More participants were lost follow-up in the MHFA group (51.9\%) compared to control (21.4\%). Both intention-to-treat (ITT) and non-ITT analyses showed that the MHFA intervention improved mental health first aid intentions (p = {\textless}.001) and decreased stigmatising attitudes towards people with mental health problems (p = .04). While ITT analysis found no significant Group x Time interaction for confidence to help a friend, the non-ITT analysis did show the intervention improved confidence to help a friend with mental health problems (p = {\textless}.001), and improved mental health knowledge (p = .003). Medical students in the intervention group reported a greater number of actual mental health first aid actions at follow-up (p = .006). Feedback about the MHFA course was generally positive, with participants stating it helped improve their knowledge and confidence to help someone.
Conclusion: This pilot study demonstrated the potential for the MHFA eLearning course to improve UK medical students’ mental health first aid skills, confidence to help a friend and stigmatising attitudes. It could be useful in supporting their own and others’ mental health while studying and in their future healthcare careers.},

Using grounded theory, this study develops a paradigm model of online learning dexterity from semi-structured interviews with 32 undergraduate and postgraduate students from a university in New Zealand. Through students’ online learning experiences during the pandemic from 2020 to 2021, online learning dexterity is found to be how students make online learning ‘just as good’ as face-to-face learning by creating and adjusting five learning manoeuvres according to developing online learning circumstances. Undergraduates and postgraduates re-use familiar study strategies as deep learning manoeuvres, but undergraduates restrict supportseeking manoeuvres to lecturers. Technical problems with online systems and poor course organisation by lecturers affected learning productivity, resulting in the need for more time optimisation manoeuvres. Social support helped students activate persistence manoeuvres to sustain online class attendance. However, undergraduates had more problems sustaining interest and engagement during class as they were not as proficient with using learning presence manoeuvres as postgraduates enrolled in distance learning programmes. The theoretical and practical significance of online learning dexterity for post-pandemic higher education is discussed.},

It addresses the need for a systematic analysis of the increasing amount of practices of learning analytics which are targeted at personalised learning. The paper summarises and highlights the characteristics and trends in relevant learning analytics practices, and illustrates their relationship with personalised learning. The analysis covers 144 related articles published between 2012 and 2019 collected from Scopus. The learning analytics practices were analysed from the dimensions of what (learning context, learning environment, and data collected), who (stakeholder), why (objective of learning analytics, and personalised learning goal), and how (learning analytics method), as well as their outcomes and limitations. The results show the diversified contexts of learning analytics, with the major ones being tertiary education and online learning. The types of data for learning analytics, which have been increasingly collected from online and emerging learning environments, are mainly related to the learning activities, academic performance, educational background and learning outcomes. The most frequent types of learning analytics objectives and personalised learning goals are enhancing learning experience, providing personal recommendations and satisfying personal learning needs. The learning analytics methods have commonly involved the use of statistical tests, classification, clustering and visualisation techniques. The findings also suggest the areas for future work to address the limitations revealed in the practices, such as investigating more cost-effective ways of offering personalised support, and the transforming role of teachers in personalised learning practices.},

The purpose of this study is to explore how ready for online teaching faculty are in a Lebanese higher education context and to investigate readiness factors that impact their online teaching. It also aims at identifying any significant differences in readiness based on gender, years of teaching experience and discipline. A survey was developed based on a review of the literature and existing surveys that address readiness factors for online teaching. The survey was administered in Spring 2020, and 210 faculty at a private higher education institution completed the survey. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) and descriptive statistics were conducted. The EFA resulted in 5 factors associated with faculty readiness to teach online, namely technology access and skills, course design, online pedagogy, attitude, and institutional support. Descriptive statistics revealed that faculty have the minimum required technology skills to teach online, yet they are faced with technical challenges associated with the context and the need for institutional support. MANOVA tests revealed a statistically significant difference between female faculty members who are readier in terms of course design and attitude than their counterpart males, a statistically significant difference in terms of course design for faculty who have more years of teaching experience. As for discipline specific readiness, majors that are focused on art and design revealed to be less ready for online teaching. This study implies the need for a more robust infrastructure to expand the delivery of online learning in Lebanon and the need for professional development for faculty to create pedagogically and technically enhanced online courses.},

	abstract = {Background: Today design thinking (DT) is employed in many areas including education and health.
Purpose of the study: To employ DT with teachers to elaborate a CPR teachers training course to make CPR training in schools cost effective and sustainable.
Methodology: A prototype CPR training program was initiated for teachers to learn CPR and then train children. Iterations where carried out as data was obtained from each subsequent course experience as DT tools including brainstorming, journey maps, ethnographic interviews helped discover problems (institutional, learning, economic, didactic) regarding implementation and help ﬁnd solutions.1
Results: After 4 years the course has evolved into a 3 phase program: learn CPR theory online, practice on hands CPR and teach CPR. Teachers prefer a combined online-plus-hands on approach to training. Free online videos and didactic material are available permanently through moodle. Manikins are rented for free and increasingly schools acquire their own. Hands-on practice includes case based scenarios, peer assessment and debrieﬁng ensuring CPR practice, assessment and teachers ability to detect errors in CPR performance. The current course also offers teachers AED provider certiﬁcation. In 4 years, over 300 teachers have been trained and approximately 85\% continue training students independently. School implementation has reached over 19,000 people, 98\% are students: primary school (59\%) Overall teacher satisfaction is 9/10 (n = 259).
Conclusions: Long term commitment and sustainability of school CPR training can be obtained when programs are designed with teachers in their speciﬁc context and not for them. Empowering teachers through DT tools and enhancing creative capital has proved successful and represents the EL ABC que Salva Vidas training program employed in Navarra schools in Spain. Given the success of the program in March 2013 CPR was introduced as curricular content in primary schools. Online content favors retention and reviewing. On hands practice improves conﬁdence and commitment to spread CPR knowledge in schools.},

	abstract = {It is known that teachers commonly utilize learning platforms equipped with Learning Analytics Dashboards (LAD) to support students in their Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) endeavors. However, students may struggle to eﬀectively employ LAD due to a lack of suﬃcient metacognitive skills. Co-regulation of learning (CoRL) has been proven to facilitate metacognitive knowledge sharing. However, the implementation of LAD with CoRL mechanisms in self-paced, asynchronous learning environments, aimed at enhancing students’ SRL, remains unclear. Investigating how students utilize a LAD with CoRL and how such a system can promote SRL in selfpaced, asynchronous courses is an important topic. This study designed a gamiﬁed LAD utilizing a futures trading market interactive interface as the CoRL mechanism. A quasiexperimental design was adopted to assess the eﬀects of the gamiﬁed LAD with CoRL on SRL, learning engagement, and academic achievement among 60 students from two Business Ethics classes over the course of a semester. The gamiﬁed LAD with CoRL had positive eﬀects on the SRL and learning engagement of the asynchronous learners in the experimental group. Signiﬁcant diﬀerences were observed in the academic achievement of the experimental and control groups. The gamiﬁed LAD with CoRL had positive eﬀects on learners in self-paced, asynchronous courses.},

	abstract = {Efforts to discourage academic misconduct in online learning environments frequently include the use of remote proctoring services. While these services are relatively commonplace in undergraduate science courses, there are open questions about students’ remote assessment environments and their concerns related to remote proctoring services. Using a survey distributed to 11 undergraduate science courses engaging in remote instruction at three American, public, research-focused institutions during the spring of 2021, we found that the majority of undergraduate students reported testing in suboptimal environments. Students’ concerns about remote proctoring services were closely tied to technological difficulties, fear of being wrongfully accused of cheating, and negative impacts on mental health. Our results suggest that remote proctoring services can create and perpetuate inequitable assessment environments for students, and additional research is required to understand the efficacy of their intended purpose to prevent cheating. We also advocate for continued conversations about the broader social and institutional conditions that can pressure students into cheating. While changes to academic culture are difficult, these conversations are necessary for higher education to remain relevant in an increasingly technological world.},

	abstract = {In online learning environments, closed-ended questions, such as multiple-choice questions, allow learners to receive immediate feedback on their answers. Although open-ended questions may be more appropriate for some learning objectives and materials, providing immediate feedback on open-ended responses remains a challenge. Self-control tasks (SCT) provide students with instant feedback on answers to open-ended questions. The focus is on comparing the student's own answer with a sample answer and reflecting on differences between the answers. The tasks are designed in such a way that deeper learning can be achieved. SCT with oral answers adds another modality and should deepen learning even more. We received valuable feedback from qualitative interviews with undergraduate students from a project management course of a central European distance university. Some of the students reported benefits from the SCTs, others experienced difficulties with the selfdirected learning that the tasks require. In the case of the SCTs with verbal input, there were also problems with the transcription. Students are required to learn to speak their answers. We would like to discuss what interventions are appropriate to help students to learn the skills for self-evaluation and self-reflection, and what is the additional benefit of a voice input for deeper learning.},

Attempts to theorise the diverse and conflicting challenges faced by students learning online during the pandemic have been limited. It is helpful to analyse students’ experiences as part of an activity system in order to unravel the system’s elements and determine contradictions that occur. This study adopted a mixed methods approach to investigate students’ online learning experiences at all eight New Zealand universities during the pandemic. Data obtained via a large-scale online survey, followed by focus groups and individual interviews, is presented in light of an Activity Theory framework. Findings show that students’ key challenges were associated with new tools and technologies, lack of interaction and social connection, lack of routine and space, and clashing commitments due to multiple roles and responsibilities. Contradictions can be a driving force for change and development in teaching and learning contexts. We conclude with recommendations for tertiary institutions, teachers, learning designers and students to inform future learning and teaching plans.},

A canonical correlation was conducted to determine whether relationships existed between the pedagogical beliefs and enacted online learning activities. Results showed that participating instructors had more student-centered beliefs than teacher-directed beliefs. Most instructors implemented activities such as reading textbooks, articles, and lecture notes frequently or extensively, whereas student-centered practices such as collaborative projects and peer review or feedback were implemented less frequently. Furthermore, the analysis revealed that online courses tend to include more student-centered activities when instructors lean more toward constructivist pedagogical beliefs. However, the data showed that student-centered beliefs co-exist with traditional teaching practices.

Unlike many countries, Sweden did not impose a lockdown or curfew, allowing students to gather in small groups on university campuses while receiving online instruction. This unique hybrid situation enhances the relevance of our findings for the post-pandemic context. Employing a participatory research methodology, we collaborated with first-year university teacher education students to co-construct their experiences as new students during COVID-19. Our research aimed to understand how the students' socio-cultural context and their university experiences influenced their learning and what insights these experiences provide regarding students' agency for learning. Through collaborative discussions and thematic analysis, we identified that students formed close-knit study groups, developed a strong sense of agency, became self-directed learners, and offered each other mutual support. Our conclusions highlight the resilience of students, the value of informal and spontaneous collaborative learning groups, the high degree of agency among students, and the potential benefits of a pedagogy that is less controlling and scaffolded, allowing for spontaneous, creative, and inquiry-directed learning. Future research could investigate whether collaborative learning groups are more effective with reduced mandatory lecture and seminar loads.},

The available literature on error climate indicates a paucity of research on the effects of perceived error climate on social aspects such as student–teacher relationships. Aims: The aim of this longitudinal study was to examine the relationship between error climate and alienation from teachers. Samples: We conducted a study with two measurement points in primary school (Grade 5 in 2017 and Grade 6 in 2018) and two samples (N = 406 students in 29 classes in Switzerland and N = 345 students in 39 classes in Luxembourg).
Methods: For scrutinizing the effect of error climate at T1 on alienation from teachers at T2, we used hierarchical linear modelling (students nested within classrooms).
Results: For both samples, the results indicated that a positive error climate at T1 predicted less alienation from teachers at T2. We also found an effect of the shared error climate on alienation from teachers.
Conclusions: The findings provide empirical evidence of the importance of improving how errors are handled in the classroom to prevent students' alienation from their teachers.},

	abstract = {Despite growing interest in exploring the application of chatbots in language education, studies on the process of chatbot-assisted language learning are scant. This qualitative study uses activity theory to understand how English as a foreign language students engage with a chatbot, Argumate, when composing argumentative essays. Five Chinese undergraduate students performed an argumentative writing task with the assistance of Argumate. Screen recordings capturing the students’ writing processes, chat logs between the students and Argumate, the students’ argumentative essays, and their responses to a post-task questionnaire survey were collected and analysed. The results indicated that the students formed a learning community with Argumate in which they used various mediating tools, including online information sources, notes, translation tools, and typing assistants, to facilitate their interaction with the chatbot. Additionally, the student–Argumate collaborative writing was shaped by rules associated with meeting task requirements and following argumentative writing conventions. At the same time, the students’ need for additional scaffolds beyond those offered by Argumate posed challenges to their collaboration. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the complex interplay among students, chatbots, and other key elements in the activity system of chatbot-assisted writing and generate insights into the application of chatbots to writing pedagogy.},

	abstract = {It is pointed out that one of the main problems of online learning environments is determining whether students engage or not. As engagement is a complex and multifaceted concept, researchers have stated that engagement is effected by many factors (environmental conditions and learner characteristics) and changes according to the context. Among these factors, discovering the effects of emotions experienced in learning processes on engagement has drawn attention recently. It is stated that there is an effect of emotions on engagement. However, the mechanisms underlying the effect of emotions experienced in online learning environment on student engagement have not yet been discovered, and what potential mediator and/or moderator variables might explain this effect. Therefore, this study aims to establish whether emotions predicted student engagement through their effect on the online learning readiness, and whether the strength of this effect was a function of metacognition. The study group includes 1601 university students. Data were gathered via online survey. The moderated mediation models were analyzed with PROCESS macro. The results displayed that emotions are powerful predictors of online learning readiness. Online readiness mediated the effect of emotions on student engagement in three models. Metacognition moderated the positive emotions and negative emotions model but did not moderate the exploratory emotions model. As a result; the direct effect of emotions on both readiness and engagement reveal the need for strategies to enable students to experience positive and exploratory emotions and to reduce negative emotions in learning environments. This study reveals that increasing students’ positive and exploratory emotions and reducing their negative emotions, ensuring their online learning readiness and high metacognition have an impact on online student engagement. Therefore, with the results of this study, it can be stated that taking into account students’ emotions, readiness and metacognition in the design of online learning environment and activities may have a positive effect on student engagement.},

However, the literature lacks a comprehensive understanding of the influential factors that play a key role in the effective implementation of online peer feedback. This systematic review provides an overview of the current state of online peer feedback implementation in higher education contexts and explores the role of students’ characteristics and online learning environments in relation to their learning processes and outcomes. To achieve this goal, the PRISMA method was followed, and a coding scheme was developed to create a framework that can guide the implementation of online peer feedback in higher education settings. This framework depicts factors that should be taken into account for effective implementation of online peer feedback in terms of four dimensions: students’ characteristics (demographic characteristics, academic background, and personality and psychological features), environmental conditions (learning platform and setting), learning processes (content, feedback activity design, and technology), and learning outcomes including cognitive outcomes (e.g., acquisition of knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation), behavioral outcomes (engagement, communication, and teamwork), and affective outcomes (satisfaction, motivation, attitude, self-efficacy, sense of autonomy, and confidence). We conclude this study by discussing the framework, limitations, and ideas for future research and practice.},

The main research objectives are to design and pilot a model to determine students’ learning styles to create personalized online courses. The study also addressed an effective method to identify learning styles and evaluate how student’s learning styles impact students’ learning outcomes. With an aim to personalize suitable content and learning process for each student, machine learning techniques have been used to detect students’ learning styles and classified them into learning styles based on the VARK model by analyzing learning activity data. Based on students’ learning styles, rules were proposed to select appropriate content and learning processes. The research results show that the SVM method performs the best among classification methods used to determine students’ learning styles. In addition, a plugin was developed on the Moodle system to support the automatic identification of students’ learning styles, based on which a learning process and appropriate content were generated to test the model’s results. The experiment results also indicate that students with a visual learning style had better learning outcomes in theory-oriented courses. In contrast, students with a kinesthetic learning style had better learning outcomes in practice-oriented courses. Although the experiment was only conducted on a small scale, the positive results show that the model can fully meet the needs of large-scale LMS systems.},

Social presence –the sense of being with others–is key to mitigating this distance. However, our understanding of social presence remains limited, despite its potential to reduce social isolation and cultivate a conducive social space in online education. A gap in our understanding relates to how social presence aligns with more general accounts of interpersonal representations under conditions of psychological distance, as presented in Construal Level Theory. We conducted a vignette-based experiment (N = 194) to examine how psychological distance in online learning affects the mental construal level of a hypothetical partner and, thus, social presence perceptions. Findings suggest that increased psychological distance leads to higher-level construals, resulting in a perception of conversation partners as non-descript and homogenous. Importantly, this affects social presence perceptions, with certain nuances. These findings can inform novel approaches to enhance social presence in online learning.},

	abstract = {In the modern world, there are an enormous number of changes due to the COVID19 pandemic. This fact influences all areas and, in particular, music education. The connection between the pandemic and changes in music education related to oboe teaching will be considered in this work. The research investigates the correlation between music education (oboe teaching) and education modes (offline and online). This correlation was tested for veracity by using statistical analysis of data sets (Student and Shapiro-Wilk tests). These data sets were obtained using a survey that evaluated practice and theoretical skills. The participants were categorized into two distinct groups for this investigation: the control group, characterized by offline education during the experimental phase, and the experimental group, which encompassed both offline and online educational modalities. The survey contained different tasks that illustrated students’ evaluations of their improvements in learning to play the oboe. A fundamental objective of this study involves substantiating the conjecture that online education, particularly in the context of the pandemic, exerts an adverse impact on oboe pedagogy. It was shown from the results (teachers’ interviews) that some problems (like lack of connection with teachers, problems related to self-education, and students’ cheating) have a negative impact on learning to play the oboe, especially on practice skills. However, most of the students evaluated their improvements at a high level, but this perspective lacked empirical basis. It should be noted that there was some improvement in theoretical knowledge, but almost all teachers thought this fact was related to cheating. It also should be noted that students evaluated their skills in the period of offline education lower than teachers.},

Results suggest that online learning, particularly the use of recorded lectures, offers several benefits for management undergraduates, including improved learning outcomes, flexibility and control, and access to a wider range of learning resources. The study also found that there is no significant difference in perceived benefits between male and female management undergraduates. These findings highlight the potential of online learning to enhance student learning outcomes and improve education quality in management. To enhance the effectiveness of online learning, educators should focus on creating engaging and interactive courses that promote active learning and student engagement. Additionally, institutions should invest in educator training and support to ensure that they are equipped with the necessary skills and knowledge to deliver effective online courses.},

	abstract = {Background  Major disruptions and changes in education have occurred worldwide as a result of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and the ensuing shift from in-person to online education. However, the effect of such changes on medical education, its magnitude, and the learning domains impacted by such rapid changes have not been adequately addressed, particularly with regard to objective assessment approaches.
Methods  Second-year medical students enrolled in our Medical English Course between 2019 and 2021 were recruited from Hokkaido University, Japan (N = 321) to participate in this study. We evaluated the potential impact of teaching styles on the academic performance of students before (2019; face-to-face) and during (2020; online; 2021; in-person and online) the pandemic. We examined the potential effect of three teaching styles––in-person (2019), online (2020), and a combination of these (2021) on the academic performance of medical students using: (i) subjective assessment of self-reported general English skills, including reading, writing, listening, and speaking; and (ii) objective assessment of medical terminology scores, evidence-based medicine (EBM) skills, and final written exam scores.
Results  In-person education significantly improved listening and speaking skills in 2019 (p {\textless} 0.001). This trend was observed for writing skills in an online course in 2020 (p = 0.001). With the combined teaching method, students reported significant improvements in all four English skills. In our objective assessments, medical terminology improved significantly post-test versus pre-test for all three teaching styles, and we found that the online course did not adversely affect the gain in medical terminology knowledge during the course. Additionally, we did not find any significant differences across the three applied teaching styles regarding EBM skill levels. It is noteworthy that the students taking online courses had a significantly higher final exam score (mean ± SD; 82.8 ± 8.2) than in in-person (78.6 ± 8.8) and combined (79.7 ± 12.1) teaching styles.
Conclusions  In our study, the online/combined courses showed better academic outcomes compared to the faceto-face course in the preclinical clerkship. Although the current results need to be replicated on a larger scale, online/ combined courses can continue and evolve in the post-pandemic education of medical students. Medical schools and institutions should consider incorporating such courses, especially combined courses, into their curricula in the future to improve the effectiveness, accessibility, and flexibility of medical education.},

	abstract = {Background  The traditional face-to-face of medical education is gradually being replaced with online education. However, the rate of adoption of online continuing medical education (OCME) as a learning method among practicing clinical physiotherapists (PTs) is unclear. The objectives of this study were to measure the satisfaction with, attitudes towards, and impact of OCME among practicing clinical PTs in Saudi Arabia (SA) and to examine the factors that affect the findings for satisfaction, attitude, and impact towards OCME.
Methods  This cross-sectional survey was conducted between October 2021 and January 2022. PTs employed at various medical facilities and specialties in Saudi Arabia completed an online survey to assess satisfaction with, attitudes towards, and impact of OCME.
Results  Of the 127 participants, 48 were female (37.8\%), 44.1\% were aged between 24 and 30 years. Overall, 57.5\% of the respondents were satisfied with OCME compared with conventional face-to-face education, and 45.7\% agreed and 18.1\% strongly agreed that OCME was more flexible. Further, 52.8\% of the respondents thought that OCME programs could supplement traditional face-to-face education. The majority of the participants (63.8\%) agreed that participating in OCME programs increased their knowledge, and 55.1\% and 51.2\% agreed that attending these programs improved patient outcomes and increased their confidence in patient management, respectively. However, only 38.6\% agreed that participating in OCME programs enhanced their clinical expertise. The mean satisfaction, attitude, and impact scores differed significantly according to age group, marital status, number of years of practice, and specialty (p {\textless} 0.0001). Multiple regression analysis showed that older age was independently associated with better satisfaction and more positive attitudes and impact. Further, having a specialization also seemed to improve the impact of OCME.
Conclusion  The PTs were satisfied with and had positive attitudes towards OCME, and also found that it had a positive impact on their clinical practice. Thus, existing OCME programs are a good option for expanding the number of PTs proficient in clinical care.},

	abstract = {Online self-assessments are discussed as an instrument to support self-regulated learning behavior of students. Online self-assessments can stimulate self-reflection on current learning experiences, a phase of self-regulated learning behavior, and can manifest itself in more elaborate self-reflection knowledge. It was hypothesized that self-reflection knowledge stimulated by an online self-assessment is relat­ ed to individual mastery and work avoidance goals (H1) and is associated with experiencing motivational expectancy discrepancy as well as uncertainty about the appropriate study choice (H2). These two hypotheses were tested on a sample of 299 student teachers. The findings showed that mastery goals favored self-knowledge about the learning situation through an online self-assessment, but work avoidance goals were not related to it. An increased self-reflection knowledge stimulated by an online self-assessment was also associated with the experience of a positive motivational expectation discrepancy, but not with uncertainty about the appropriate study choice.},

	abstract = {The use of virtual reality (VR) for the improvement of learning outcomes for accounting studies is an area in which the research is still limited. Technology-based accounting learning is very important because, currently, the accounting profession is very much affected by rapid technological change which means that it must adapt to remain relevant in the business world. This study aims to examine the role of the mediating effect of task-technology fit (TTF) on the relationship between the use of VR and learning outcomes for accounting studies. This research model states that the use of VR will be able to increase TTF, technology quality and accessibility, and then increase reflective thinking and reduce cognitive overload thereby increasing perceived learning effectiveness (PLE). The hypotheses derived from this model were tested empirically using survey data from 199 users of VR engaged in accounting studies. The data analysis uses partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), and the results support the hypothesis that TTF mediates the relationship between VR use, learning behavior, and PLE.},

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether quantitative sex and gender biases do exist in popular anatomy e-­learning platforms and compare the results with those found in contemporary textbooks and atlases. A systematic content-­analysis was performed on N = 3767 images published from 2008 to 2021 in which sex/gender could be identified by considering technical aspects of illustration and various intersectional categories. E-­learning platforms took into account an appropriate representation of the female body and presented even more females (n = 932/1412; 66\%), more frequently from a ventral/anterior (χ2 = 26, P {\textless} 0.001) and whole-­body perspective (χ2 = 27, P {\textless} 0.001). This was in contrast to German anatomy books, where the results pointed to a significant sex and gender bias. For example, all books assessed underrepresented females (n = 707/2355; 30\%) and placed them in stereotypical sex-­specific context (χ2 = 348, P {\textless} 0.001), showing them more often from a caudal/inferior (χ2 = 99, P {\textless} 0.001) and internal (χ2 = 132, P {\textless} 0.001) perspective. Altogether, the visual representation of sex and gender in anatomical curricula is still biased and the stereotypical perceptions of human anatomy seem to be a global issue. However, the increasing use of electronic learning platforms, which gradually replace traditional books is changing the way the male and female body is depicted, which might offer new opportunities for reducing stereotypes in anatomy education.},

This two-­group longitudinal study investigated the development of such transfer of learning in a histology course. After 0, 10, and 20 sessions of the 10-­week-l­ong course, medical students completed theoretical tasks, examined histological slides trained in the course (retention task), and unfamiliar histological slides (transfer task). The results showed that students in the histology group gradually outperformed the control group in all tasks, especially in the second half of the course, η2 = 0.268 (p {\textless} 0.001). The best predictor of final transfer performance was students’ retention performance after 10 sessions, β = 0.32 (p = 0.028), and theoretical knowledge after 20 sessions, β = 0.46 (p = 0.003). Results of eye tracking methodology further revealed that the histology group engaged in greater “visual activity” when solving transfer tasks, as indicated by an increase in the total fixation count, η2 = 0.103 (p = 0.014). This longitudinal study provides evidence that medical students can use what they learn in histology courses to solve unfamiliar problems but cautions that positive transfer effects develop relatively late in the course. Thus, course time and the complex relationship between theory, retention, and transfer holds critical implications for anatomical curricula seeking to foster the transfer of learning.},

Anatomical learning environments have been repeatedly shown to play a critical role in forming such an identity; however, relevance of PIF during sonoanatomical training remains underexplored. At the end of their basic anatomy studies, third-­semester medical students took part in a four-­day block course on anatomy and imaging. Anatomical content was revised in small groups using peer teaching and imaging methods, including one hour of hands-­on sonoanatomy sessions each day. On-­site sonoanatomy was identified as an excellent format to support students' transition from the pre-­clinical to clinical phase as medical experts-­to-­be. Students enjoyed practical exercises and the clinical input, which increased their interest in the medical profession and their academic studies. This study further examined the effects of the transition into an online-­only format, necessitated by the current Covid-­19 pandemic. A comparison was made between the quantitative and qualitative evaluation data, and the written results of examinations of several on-­site (n = 1096, mean age = 22.4 years ± 2.18), and online-­only cohorts (n = 230, mean age = 22.6 years ± 2.21). The online-­only transition led to a reduction of all PIF-­related variables measured, losing identity-­related variables, increasing students' stress levels, and reducing their long-­term academic performance. Together, this study demonstrates presence of PIF in undergraduate sonoanatomy teaching, and cautions against the uncritical online-­only substitution of hands-­on learning environments.},

The aim of this study was to communicate principles from resilient healthcare to clinicians through a serious video game, and to evaluate the game’s feasibility as a prompt to reflect on practice. The game, Resilience Challenge, is scenario-based and requires players to resolve dilemmas in clinical practice. It was disseminated online, and was played 1949 times during the four-month study. The game was evaluated using an immediate cross-sectional survey, which included both Likert-style and free text responses. Participants reported that the game was engaging (93\%) and that they would recommend it to others (89\%). Fewer participants reported learning about resilient healthcare concepts (64\%). Resilience Challenge is a promising way to prompt reflections about clinical work, and demonstrates mixed outcomes in communicating resilient healthcare principles to clinicians.},

However, research informs us that online learners are usually less likely to complete the learning experience and more likely to drop out compared to learners studying in traditional face-to-face learning environments. One major factor for low completion rates emerges as learners’ satisfaction with the learning experience. The purposes of the study were to investigate the structural relationships among the factors that affect online learners’ satisfaction and to develop a structural model that explains satisfaction in online learning environments. We used social cognitive theory and the Macro Model of Motivation and Performance as theoretical frameworks and investigated the structural relationships among metacognitive self-regulation, self-efficacy for interacting with the instructor and peers, task value, learning design, perceived learning, and satisfaction with the learning experience. Participants consisted of 1297 higher education students who were enrolled in fully online courses. We adopted the structural equation modeling approach to investigate the relationships among the factors in the research model. Results revealed that selfregulation, self-efficacy, task value, and learning design had significant effects on perceived learning and satisfaction and perceived learning significantly influenced satisfaction. Moreover, learning design had a large effect on perceived learning and perceived learning mediated the relationships between satisfaction and self-efficacy, task value, and learning design. The findings have implications for designing online learning environments that incorporate learning design standards and generate greater levels of learning outcomes.},

However, the success of this approach is governed by different factors, which have been accentuated in recent years. The implementation of peer assessment is consequently a challenging task in the current context. This work investigates peer assessment strategies in seven Computer Engineering courses. Students’ performance and assessment accuracy are analyzed throughout five academic years, covering the transition from offline to online methodologies according to the evolution of educational environments. More specifically, peer and lecturer’s grades are examined to identify correlations or deviations in two execution phases. The first phase involves the analysis of in-class offline peer assessments during four academic years, integrated as part of continuous assessment tasks. The second phase deals with the evaluation of online peer assessments in 2021/2022, considering different platforms to manage submissions and reviews. The offline experience denotes statistical correlations between the grades assigned by the peers and the lecturer, while also revealing patterns that affected the performance of students. In addition, the switch to online methodologies does not significantly affect the assessments in courses that adopted peer strategies in the past. Finally, comparable results are obtained under single-blind and double-blind models after careful training.},

Negative and positive achievement emotions play an important role in engagement. In the light of Control-Value Theory and the Extended Process Model of Emotion Regulation, a model was developed and tested to investigate the relationship between student engagement and the antecedents of emotions. Participants consisted of 1450 pre-service teachers who were enrolled in degree programs at Faculties of Education in Turkey. The structural equation modeling method was used to test two research models developed for positive and negative achievement emotions. In the negative achievement emotions model, student engagement was influenced by control of learning beliefs, task value, negative achievement emotions, and reappraisal strategy, and these variables together explained 83.1\% of the total variance in engagement. In the positive achievement emotions model, results revealed the effect of control of learning beliefs, task value, positive achievement emotions, and reappraisal strategy on student engagement, and these variables together explained 97.3\% of the total variance in engagement. The findings have implications for expanding the theoretical knowledge about emotions and emotion regulation strategies to improve student engagement in online learning environments. This study suggests that it is important to pay attention to task value and emotions when designing online instruction and online learning materials and courses.},

	abstract = {The transition from traditional, in-person classrooms to technology-based models like online learning is a significant challenge. This change is not only brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, but it also presents difficulties for low-income and developing countries that have adopted online education for students who are spread out over a wide area. Students from low-income and developing countries, where the teaching and learning process is limited to a classroom environment, are struggling to adjust to online learning. This study aims to shed light on the multifaceted dimensions of the students’ educational journey, their adaptation to alternative learning environments, and the intricate interplay between sociocultural factors and individual identity trajectories within the Nepalese context. Based on indepth interviews with 15 graduate students who were also school teachers, the study found that student’s identities underwent some instability as tension arose between their self-perception in face-to-face and online learning. The students experienced changes in who they were in the face-to-face classroom and who they are in online learning, as well as changes in how society viewed them as online learners.},

We designed a framework to promote decision-making training with a multidimensional scaffolding-based game, and 84 participants were recruited online to evaluate the game based on the proposed framework. The quasi-experimental study compared collaborative and individual learners’ game performance, anxiety, motivation, acceptance, behavior patterns, and perceived learning process for decision-making. The result showed that both collaborative and individual learners had low anxiety, high motivation, and high acceptance in the multidimensional scaffolding-based online educational game; however, the collaborative team had better game performance and found the clues to be more useful for the learning process than the individual team did. Behavioral pattern analysis revealed that the high-performance collaborative team had more well-organized problem-solving and in-depth reflection.},

	abstract = {Background  Medical diagnostics is a pivotal bridge curriculum that receives much less attention from undergraduates in non-clinical medicine health profession programs with less student engagement and poor performance. Mind mapping is an active learning strategy for graphically presenting radiant thinking to culture clinical reasoning. The purpose of this study was to explore whether students’ comprehensive diagnostic skills are enhanced through increased student engagement by employing mind mapping. Methods  We implemented mind mapping in small-grouped workshops with 86 junior undergraduates from preventive medicine program, for physical diagnostic sessions including physical examination (PE) maneuver, electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation and medical history collection. We also conducted assessments of the above skills, as well as online surveys regarding their expectation on this course, self-evaluation of mind mapping in teaching and the learning process of all the modules. Results  Group members employing mind mapping in all PE sessions obtained higher scores in the heart and lung systems during the PE maneuver exam. Similarly, groups that made more in-depth mind maps achieved higher scores on the ECG quiz. In addition, groups displaying mind maps for history taking from normal classes and reformed class exhibited greater completeness of medical history with both standardized patients and real patients, which was consistent with increased collection of accompanying symptoms. Mind mapping was valued by the majority of students for its benefits in terms of acquiring PE maneuver, theoretical knowledge, medical history collection and medical records writing, clinical reasoning, communication skills, sense of teamwork and cooperation, professionalism and humanistic literacy. Discussion  The visual feature of mind mapping evoked extensive behavioral engagement in all groups, as did cognitive and emotional engagement, as the majority of students expressed their willingness and affective reactions. In the short term, the positive feedbacks encourage growing engagement. The continuous benefits of mind mapping require long-term observation.},

	abstract = {Background:  Despite global interest in the interface of Algorithmically-driven writing tools (ADWTs) and academic integrity, empirical data considering educators’ perspectives on the challenges, benefits, and policies of ADWTs use remain scarce. Aim:  This study responds to calls for empirical investigation concerning the affordances and encumbrances of ADWTs, and their implications for academic integrity.
Methods:  Using a cross-sectional survey research design, we recruited through snowball sampling 100 graduate students and faculty members representing ten disciplines. Participants completed an online survey on perceptions, practices, and policies in the utilization of ADWTs in education. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) helped us understand the factors influencing the acceptance and use of ADWTs.
Results:  The study found that teacher respondents highly value the diverse ways ADWTs can support their educational goals (perceived usefulness). However, they must overcome their barrier threshold such as limited access to these tools (perception of external control), a perceived lack of knowledge on their use (computer self-efficacy), and concerns about ADWTs’ impact on academic integrity, creativity, and more (output quality).
Conclusion:  AI technologies are making headway in more educational institutions because of their proven and potential benefits for teaching, learning, assessment, and research. However, AI in education, particularly ADWTs, demands critical awareness of ethical protocols and entails collaboration and empowerment of all stakeholders by introducing innovations that showcase human intelligence over AI or partnership with AI.},

For a long time, research on self-esteem followed a variable-centered approach, considering mostly the individual facets of self-esteem to be relevant. In this article, we investigate different combinations of self-esteem level, stability, and contingency as well as their relations with learning and performance. Across three online-studies (ntotal = 2 499), latent profile analyses revealed four self-esteem profiles beside the profile of “optimal self-esteem” (Kernis, 2003). These profiles are associated with different consequences. For example, the profile “optimal self-esteem” yields the most favorable results pattern, such as the use of deep processing strategies. Overall, our findings suggest that a multidimensional view of self-esteem allows for more precise predictions of learning-related behaviors. Implications for future research and practice are discussed.},

Participants were students in a hybrid graduate-level course with weekly synchronous computer-mediated discussions. Adapting Du Bois’ stancetaking triangle, we coded discussion transcripts for shifts in stance and for evidence of influence on students’ perspective taking as they considered course concepts. Findings were that stances and stance objects (that is, topics) were introduced as students collaborated in discussion, with an epistemic stance indicating students’ primary focus on wanting to learn and understand course concepts. Evaluative and affective stances were less frequent and most often intertwined with an epistemic stance but nevertheless important in supporting the group’s discussion. Synchronous online discussions afforded a venue for iterative discourse interactions of evaluation, positioning, and alignment and for shared knowledge co-construction and perspectival understanding.},

In this study, we investigate the impact of counselling instances supported by a learning analytics (LA) tool, called TrAC, which provides specific data about the curriculum and grades of each student. To evaluate the tool, we measured changes in students' performance ranking position over 3 years and compared the performance of students who received counselling with and without the tool. Our results show that using the tool is related to an improvement in cohort ranking. We further investigated the characteristics of counselled students using cluster analyses. The findings highlight the potential beneficial influence on academic outcomes arising from the provision of guidance to students regarding their course load decisions via TrAC-­mediated counselling. This study contributes to the field of LA by providing evidence of the impact of counselling supported by an LA tool in a real-­world setting over a long period of time.

	abstract = {Dentistry education is a critical component of healthcare systems globally, but its structure and quality vary signiﬁcantly across high-income, middle-income, and low-income developing countries. This chapter delves into the nuances of dentistry education within these three categories, exploring aspects such as history, admission requirements, curriculum, teaching strategies, assessment methods, practical experiences, accreditation, and more. The study also examines the impact of socioeconomic factors on students and faculty, workforce dynamics, access to education, online learning, and community engagement. In high-income countries, dentistry education has a long history with stringent admission requirements and comprehensive curricula. Teaching strategies blend traditional methods with advanced technologies, and a wide array of resources are available. However, high costs, oversupply of professionals, and disparities in access to care pose challenges. Middle-income countries have made strides in dental education, offering balanced curricula with a strong clinical focus. These nations strive for equitable access and invest in community outreach programs. Limited resources and faculty shortages remain challenges, but partnerships with high-income countries contribute to progress. Low-income developing countries face resource constraints but prioritize practical skills development and community-based training. Efforts are underway to enhance quality and achieve accreditation with international support. Dental education in these countries not only addresses workforce shortages but also promotes access to care among marginalized populations. Interprofessional education is gaining traction, emphasizing collaboration with other healthcare providers. Intraprofessional education promotes teamwork within the dental profession itself. This chapter underscores the need for international collaboration, resource allocation, and research capacity building. Achievements include producing competent dental professionals and addressing oral health disparities, while challenges encompass ﬁnancial constraints, access disparities, and faculty shortages. By promoting research, exploring innovative teaching methods, and bridging access gaps, dental education can continue to evolve and contribute to improved global oral health.},

This chapter explores the achievements, facilitators, barriers, challenges, and recommendations related to CPD in these contexts. The achievements of CPD in developing countries include increased access to resources, enhanced medical knowledge, and improved collaboration among healthcare professionals. Facilitators such as professional organizations, academic institutions, and online platforms have played a signiﬁcant role in supporting CPD initiatives. However, barriers and challenges persist, including limited resources, lack of awareness, time constraints, and language/cultural barriers. To address these challenges, recommendations such as government support, technology integration, localized content, ﬁnancial assistance, and collaborations with international organizations have been proposed. Implementing these recommendations can strengthen CPD programs for physicians in developing countries, enabling them to stay updated with medical advancements and provide high-quality healthcare services. This, in turn, contributes to improved patient outcomes and the overall development of healthcare systems in these regions.},

While studies have explored various socio-emotional learning outcomes, learners’ psychological safety has yet to be explored as healthcare professionals engage in collaborative problem-solving. To address this gap, the qualitative study employed semi-structured interviews to understand occupational therapy students’ (N = 10) perceptions of psychological safety as they engaged in an online learning class. The resulting themes of this study described the feelings associated with different forms of interactions requiring psychological safety: (a) being vulnerable, (b) fear of being misunderstood, (c) need to protect/protection, and (d) group cohesion. The findings have implications for online learner-learner interactions and computer-supported collaborative learning. For example, learners discussed how the perceived permanence of online learning lead to a sense of self-preservation and reticence to discuss the ill-structured and potentially controversial nature of complex problems. Additional aspects of psychological safety in online learning highlighted the importance of shared experiences, learning from failure, and community building.},

This study explored the validation of technology acceptance on collaborative teamwork in the implementation of a virtual museum and making storytelling. Two questionnaires were employed as the main instrument to collect the data from 122 higher education students. The findings indicate that five of twelve hypotheses were supported. Following the result, it is known that perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness significantly affects attitude toward use, perceived usefulness significantly affects teamwork quality, and attitude toward use significantly affects collaborative results. The other seven hypotheses that failed to be supported can represent the important activities and related features that need to be highlighted in designing a virtual museum used in storytelling under collaborative design. Therefore, it will help educational practices to design the features in the app matched by activities in collaborative and storytelling.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study is to explore new ways of assessing collaborative problem solving (CPS) processes based on different modalities of audio data and their combination. The data collection took place in an educational lab setting during an experiment with adult teams from professional contexts who collaboratively solved multiple problems as part of a CPS training. From audio data, both verbal (ie, speech) and non-verbal (ie, pitch) aspects were extracted. Four analysis methods were used, including (a) content analysis; (b) linguistic inquiry and word count; (c) verbal entrainment analysis; and (d) acoustic–prosodic entrainment based on pitch data. Insights are given into the CPS processes of the participating groups using these measures and relevant relationships between some of these measures are further investigated. Based on content analysis, it was found that most of the interactions during the CPS process are task oriented, whereas team-oriented interactions are less present. Second, three measures of proportion of contribution in CPS were investigated and clear differences in participation patterns between and within teams were found. We suggest that a combination of utterance count and words per sentence could provide valuable insights for quantity and equality of participation. Third, the study explored pronoun use and found that the most frequently used personal pronouns were first-person singular. Next, the results indicated a relationship between pronoun use and the relative frequency of interactions. Fourth, a rather weak relationship between lexical entrainment measures and the acoustic–prosodic measures were found, suggesting that these measures are indicative of separate communicative aspects in CPS. This study contributes to a better understanding of which type of audio-based data is most informative to teachers and students as a feedback or assessment tool. This study complements previous research as it focuses on spoken human-to-human communication collected in an authentic context. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Support and guidance systems for learning coaches, teachers and learners are needed to foster the educational quality of collaborative problem solving (CPS) activities. CPS is a complex process and measuring the quality of CPS processes remains challenging. Multimodal learning analytics, focusing on verbal and non-verbal data sources and using content analysis, linguistic inquiry and word count and verbal and acoustic entrainment measures could be valuable to measure the quality of CPS. What this paper adds The majority of interactions during CPS processes are task oriented or cognitive of nature, whereas team-oriented interactions are less present. Utterance count and words per sentence should be used in combination, as they are indicative of different aspects. Pronoun use in learners' discourse is related to the types of CPS interactions. Lexical entrainment measures and acoustic–prosodic are indicative of distinctive communicative aspects in CPS. Implications for practice and/or policy Quality indicators of CPS processes should include both verbal and non-verbal measures of students' interactions. Educational researchers and the (Edtech) industry should further leverage their forces to foster the development of (semi-)automated systems for measuring the quality of CPS processes. It should be further investigated how quality indicators of CPS processes can be most meaningful to trainers, teachers and learners, for example, through the use of dashboards.},

	abstract = {Multimodal learning analytics (MMLA) research has made significant progress in modelling collaboration quality for the purpose of understanding collaboration behaviour and building automated collaboration estimation models. Deploying these automated models in authentic classroom scenarios, however, remains a challenge. This paper presents findings from an evaluation of collaboration quality estimation models. We collected audio, video and log data from two different Estonian schools. These data were used in different combinations to build collaboration estimation models and then assessed across different subjects, different types of activities (collaborative-writing, group-discussion) and different schools. Our results suggest that the automated collaboration model can generalize to the context of different schools but with a 25\% degradation in balanced accuracy (from 82\% to 57\%). Moreover, the results also indicate that multimodality brings more performance improvement in the case of group-discussion-based activities than collaborative-writing-based activities. Further, our results suggest that the video data could be an alternative for understanding collaboration in authentic settings where higher-quality audio data cannot be collected due to contextual factors. The findings have implications for building automated collaboration estimation systems to assist teachers with monitoring their collaborative classrooms. Practitioners notes What is already known about this topic Multimodal learning analytics researchers have established several features as potential indicators for collaboration quality, e.g., speaking time or joint visual attention. The current state of the art has shown the feasibility of building automated collaboration quality models. Recent research has provided preliminary evidence of the generalizability of developed automated models across contexts different in terms of given task and subject. What does this paper add This paper offers collaboration indicators for different types of collaborative learning activities in authentic classroom settings. The paper includes a systematic investigation into collaboration quality automated model's generalizability across different tasks, types of tasks and schools. This paper also offers a comparison between different modalities' potential to estimate collaboration quality in authentic settings. Implications for practice The findings inform the development of automated collaboration monitoring systems for authentic classroom settings.

	abstract = {Scaffolds that support self-regulated learning (SRL) have been found to improve learning outcomes. The effects of scaffolds can differ depending on how learners use them and how specific scaffolds might influence learning processes differently. Personalized scaffolds have been proposed to be more beneficial for learning due to their adaptivity to learning progress and individualized content to learning needs. The present study investigated finer-grained effects of how personalized scaffolds driven by a rule-based artificial intelligence system influenced SRL processes, especially how students learned with them. Using a pre-post experimental design, we investigated personalized scaffolds based on university students' real-time learning processes in a technologically enhanced learning environment. Students in the experimental group (n = 30) received personalized scaffolds, while the control group (n = 29) learned without scaffolds. All students completed a 45-minute learning task with trace data recorded. Findings indicated scaffold effects on students' subsequent learning behaviour. Additionally, only scaffold interaction correlated to essay performance and suggests that the increase in frequencies of SRL activities alone does not contribute directly to learning outcomes. As guidelines for real-time SRL support are lacking, this study provides valuable insights to enhance SRL support with adaptive learning technologies. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Self-regulated learning scaffolds, especially adaptive scaffolds, improve learning. Personalized scaffolds have effects on self-regulated learning activities. Past research focused on aggregated effects of scaffolds. What this paper adds Investigates how students learn with personalized scaffolds in terms of frequencies of learning activities and scaffold interaction. Takes a closer look at which learning activities and when the effects of personalized scaffolds occur. Examines how finer-grained effects of personalized scaffolds correspond to learning outcomes. Implications for practice and/or policy Personalized scaffold effects vary across learning, and future research should consider finer-grained investigations of SRL support in order to better understand their influence on learning. The number of personalized scaffolds provided should be reconsidered in the future as students only use some of the support provided, especially when task demands increase. Personalized scaffold interaction is linked to improvement in task performance, so future research should also focus on students' appropriate use of self-regulated learning support.},

	abstract = {Multisensory-rich VR experiences, which encompass visual, auditory, and haptic stimuli, have the potential to enhance engagement, motivation, and learning. However, extensive sensory stimuli could also compromise learning through sensory overload. In museum settings, visitors who are inundated with excessive stimuli such as unrelated background music or competing visual options may not experience optimal learning. This mixed-methods study addressed this potential problem by exploring the impact of sound on learning, enjoyment, sense of presence, and the development of interest among museum attendees (N = 255) who used two different types of technology: high-immersion VR or a tablet. Results from a one-way MANOVA revealed that learning and sense of presence were unaffected by the technology used unless sound was added. Using a tablet with sound lowered the sense of presence. Participants in the VR condition with or without sound had significantly higher enjoyment scores than those in either tablet condition. The development of interest was not significantly affected by any condition, regardless of whether sound was used. The research findings have implications for implementing VR for learning in museum settings. For instance, VR can enhance a sense of presence in museum exhibits, but a sense of presence may be significantly diminished when museum visitors use tablets with sound. Additional recommendations for the use of multimodal VR in museums are provided. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic VR can support an immersive and engaging experience for users. VR is more immersive than tablets. When designed effectively, sound can increase immersion and engagement. When integrated into the visual environment, sound can add authenticity to the learning content. VR can complement museum exhibits as it allows museum visitors to extend their learning experiences. What this paper adds VR enriched with sound can significantly and positively impact sense of presence. Compared with a soundless VR exhibition, VR enriched with sound enhances engagement of museum visitors by drawing their attention to the content of the exhibits. VR with and without sound can support learning and add enjoyment to museum visitor experiences. Implications for practice and/or policy Developers interested in adding sound to VR should ensure that the visual and auditory experiences are directly related to the desired content delivery. Museum exhibit creators and curators should consider the use of VR to provide dynamic learning experiences that increase enjoyment and presence.},

	abstract = {The paper argues that learning analytics as a research field can benefit from a theory-informed shared language to describe sensemaking of learning and teaching data. To make the case for such shared language, first, I critically review prominent sensemaking theories to then demonstrate how studies in learning analytics do not use coherent descriptions of sensemaking, eclectically combining the paradigms that have underlying differences. I then propose a conceptualization of sensemaking that overcomes the differences between these theories and explains how the concepts of activity system, the definition of the situation and affordances can be used to capture individual differences in sensemaking. The paper concludes with a preliminary framework and examples demonstrating its utility in raising new theoretical questions, informing design principles and providing shared language for researchers in learning analytics.Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Sensemaking happens when individuals try to explain unknown situations. Learning analytics uses sensemaking as a lens to understand dashboard use. Systematic analysis of sensemaking is essential for learning analytics. What this paper adds The paper notes that noticing and perceiving are commonly examined in learning analytics on dashboard use. The paper suggests a revision of fundamental assumptions in sensemaking. A paper proposes a toy model of sensemaking that includes operationalization of the definition of the situation, activity where sensemaking happens and processes of noticing and perceiving affordances. Implications for practice and/or policy Learning analytics must examine sensemaking of data about teaching and learning in a systematic manner. Internal perceptions of the social environment and activity that are informed by the data need to be considered in evaluating dashboard use.},

	abstract = {Help seeking has traditionally been studied in face-to-face settings using self-report instruments measuring learners' internal inclinations for help seeking (eg, perceived benefits and threats). Much less is known about help seeking in online learning. Furthermore, external environmental factors such as a positive climate were found to encourage help seeking. Utilizing peer-help analytics as well as self-report measures, this study simultaneously modelled the structural relationships among students' perceived class climate, internal help-seeking inclinations, help-seeking engagement, participation in peer help and performance in an online class. Results from structural equation modelling indicated that students' perceived goal structure of an online class had a significant influence on their internal help-seeking inclinations, which subsequently affected their help-seeking engagement, participation in peer help and learning outcomes. Instructors of online classes should pay particular attention to fostering a mastery-oriented climate in order to encourage help seeking and improve academic performance. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Help seeking is important for academic success. Due to a variety of individual and contextual factors, students often do not seek help despite the need. Existing research on help seeking focuses on the face-to-face setting and relies on self-report measures. Students' help-seeking inclinations and patterns may differ between in-person classes and the online environment. What this paper adds This study examined help seeking in an online class through self-report measures and objective analytics data. This study modelled the structural relationships among the external climate of an online class, students' internal help-seeking inclinations, engagement in help seeking, participation in peer help and course performance. Structural equation modelling found that the goal structure of an online class influenced students' internal help-seeking inclinations. Online students' internal help-seeking inclinations affected their grades through their participation in help seeking. Implications for practice and/or policy A mastery-oriented class climate elicits online learners' positive help-seeking inclinations while discouraging negative ones. The design and teaching of online classes should aim to foster a mastery-oriented climate. Online classes should offer peer-help opportunities and encourage student participation, which is conducive to academic performance.},

	abstract = {This study explored the influence of the dynamic assessment of human–computer interactive games on children's language potential. Thirty-seven special children aged 3–7 years were selected to participate in the study. They were divided into three groups according to their scores on the Autism Behaviour Checklist: (1) a non-autism group, (2) a suspected autism group and (3) an autism group. In two stages of static and dynamic assessment, all three groups of children completed language tests under the conditions of no mediated prompt and mediated prompts, and the data generated in the game interactions were processed and analysed. The findings suggest the following: (1) static assessment may ignore children's language potential, while dynamic assessment can measure and differentiate children's potential language development ability; (2) children with ASD need more mediation prompts and are more likely to complete tasks with explicit mediation prompts; (3) children with ASD have weaker language potential, and children with suspected ASD or non-ASD children have homogeneous language potential; and (4) assessors should pay timely attention to and maintain children's learning status and psychological changes. This study demonstrates the importance of human–computer interactive games as a dynamic assessment tool to tap into children's language potential and to determine their proximal developmental zone, which has important implications for teachers in understanding groups with different language abilities. Practitioner notes What is already known about the topic? The traditional language assessment paradigm (static assessment) can only evaluate the learners' current language development ability, while the short-term development potential may not be observed. Different prompts in the mediation strategy can be used as a quantitative assessment paradigm in dynamic assessment. Much of the dynamic assessment in children with ASD focuses on language vocabulary learning outcomes and lacks measurement or quantification of language potential. What this paper adds? Presents a method for the dynamic assessment of a human–computer interactive language game suitable for children aged 3–7 years with ASD. Quantifies the potential level of language skills in children with varying degrees of ASD. Objectively and dynamically compares differences in language development potential between different groups. In dynamic assessment, children's learning status and psychological changes should be paid attention to and maintained in time. Implications for practice, research or policy This paper provides a concrete example of how human–computer interactive games can be used to dynamically assess the language potential of children with ASD. These findings highlight the importance of progressive scaffolds (mediated prompts) in children's language learning, which can help children identify and solve problems in a timely manner. For educational developers, language intervention materials should be prepared in a way that encompasses the different levels of language skills of children with different disabilities, that is, within the individual's zone of proximal development.},

	abstract = {This study investigated the added value of real-time adaptive feedback on seventh graders' performances in tablet-based geometry learning. To isolate the effects of the medium (ie, tablet) from those of the feedback, three groups were compared: paper-and-pencil, pen-based tablet without feedback and pen-based tablet with feedback. The feedback was provided by a tutoring system based on an artificial intelligence that automatically interpreted students' pen strokes on the screen. A total of 85 French students drew three geometric shapes, either on paper or on a tablet, and then performed a transfer task on paper. Results showed that using a tablet without feedback did not improve learning but seemed to enhance interest in the task compared to the paper-and-pencil group. Students in the tablet with feedback group performed significantly better than the other two groups on learning, as well as on transfer. This study was the first to combine media comparison and added-value approaches to test the effects on students' geometry performances of using a new educational app on a pen-based tablet in a naturalistic classroom environment. Results showed that it was not the medium used but the intelligent tutoring system-based feedback that improved students' performance. Our data therefore indicate that artificial intelligence is a promising way of providing learners with real-time adaptive feedback in order to improve their performances. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Previous meta-analyses have investigated the effects of tablet-based learning. Tablet computers have been proven to increase students' motivation. Yet, the influence of tablet computers on learning outcomes remains inconclusive. Other studies show that certain features of environments, such as feedback, have positive effects on learning. What this paper adds Most of the previous studies adopted a media comparison approach (paper- vs. tablet-based instruction). We combine this approach with an added-value approach by adding or not real-time AI-based feedback. Results showed that tablet use increased children's interest but not their learning outcomes. Feedback improved children's performance in a training task and a later transfer paper task. Implications for practice and/or policy Tablet computers can promote students' interest in the task during geometry instruction. App features play a critical role in improving students' learning. Specifically, IA-based adaptive feedback helps children to perform better on a geometry task.},

	abstract = {To date, extensive work has been devoted to incorporating computational thinking in K-12 education. Recognizing students' computational thinking stages in game-based learning environments is essential to capture unproductive learning and provide appropriate scaffolding. However, few reliable and valid computational thinking measures have been developed, especially in games, where computational knowledge acquisition and computational skill construction are implicit. This study introduced an innovative approach to explore students' implicit computational thinking through various explicit factors in game-based learning, with a specific focus on Zoombinis, a logical puzzle-based game designed to enhance students' computational thinking skills. Our results showed that factors such as duration, accuracy, number of actions and puzzle difficulty were significantly related to students' computational thinking stages, while gender and grade level were not. Besides, findings indicated gameplay performance has the potential to reveal students' computational thinking stages and skills. Effective performance (shorter duration, fewer actions and higher accuracy) indicated practical problem-solving strategies and systematic computational thinking stages (eg, Algorithm Design). This work helps simplify the process of implicit computational thinking assessment in games by observing the explicit factors and gameplay performance. These insights will serve to enhance the application of gamification in K-12 computational thinking education, offering a more efficient method to understanding and fostering students' computational thinking skills. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Game-based learning is a pedagogical framework for developing computational thinking in K-12 education. Computational thinking assessment in games faces difficulties because students' knowledge acquisition and skill construction are implicit. Qualitative methods have widely been used to measure students' computational thinking skills in game-based learning environments. What this paper adds Categorize students' computational thinking experiences into distinct stages and analyse recurrent patterns employed at each stage through sequential analysis. This approach serves as inspiration for advancing the assessment of stage-based implicit learning with machine learning methods. Gameplay performance and puzzle difficulty significantly relate to students' computational thinking skills. Researchers and instructors can assess students' implicit computational thinking by observing their real-time gameplay actions. High-performing students can develop practical problem-solving strategies and exhibit systematic computational thinking stages, while low-performing students may need appropriate interventions to enhance their computational thinking practices. Implications for practice and/or policy Introduce a practical method with the potential for generalization across various game-based learning to better understand learning processes by analysing significant correlations between certain gameplay variables and implicit learning stages. Allow unproductive learning detection and timely intervention by modelling the reflection of gameplay variables in students' implicit learning processes, helping improve knowledge mastery and skill construction in games. Further investigations on the causal relationship between gameplay performance and implicit learning skills, with careful consideration of more performance factors, are expected.},

	abstract = {Training to run is not straightforward since without proper personalised supervision and planning, people will not improve their performance and will increase the risk of injuries. This study aims to identify the different factors that influence running training programmes, examining the benefits, challenges or limitations of personalised plans. Moreover, this study explores how multimodal, immersive and artificial intelligence technologies can support personalised training. We conducted an exploratory sequential mixed research consisting of interviews with 11 running coaches from different countries and a survey of 12 running coaches. Based on the interviews and survey analysis, we identified and extracted relevant factors of the training process. We identified four relevant aspects for running training: physical, technical, mental and body awareness. Using these aspects as a reference, we derived a framework using a bottom-up approach. This framework proposes multimodal, immersive and artificial intelligence technologies to facilitate personalised running training. It also allows coaches to personally guide their athletes on each aspect. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Running is a popular sport that provides health benefits and is practised by many people around the world. Training is a process that enables athletes to improve their development in various aspects of their sport; in the case of running, it helps them to increase their speed and endurance. Personalised training supports the needs and abilities of athletes, by helping them to achieve their potential through individualised activities or programmes. Sports science research indicates that personalised training can be improved by applying technology to tackle its challenges and limitations. What this paper adds We show that personalising the training requires not only focusing on the runners' physical condition but also on their mental, technical and body awareness aspects, where each of them has a different adaptation to training. We show that multimodal and immersive technologies offer suitable and portable ways to measure and target the mental and body awareness aspects during running training. Implications for practice and/or policy This paper presents a list of factors, measures and devices that coaches can use to plan and design their training sessions in a more personalised manner. This study can serve as a foundation for future research that aims to identify and target the various factors that influence the learning and training of sports.},

	abstract = {Teacher education has begun to embrace the use of 360 videos to improve preservice teachers' (PSTs) engagement and immersion. While recent research on such use is promising overall, there are specific questions that have been left unanswered about the construct of presence in 360 videos. More specifically, research has yet to fully explore how video delivery devices and PST characteristics may impact presence. The purpose of this study was to respond to this gap in the literature by examining PST major, delivery device (ie, head mounted display vs. flat screen), and the interaction between the two in informing presence. A total of 93 PSTs watched 360 videos and then completed a questionnaire. Findings indicated that presence in head-mounted displays was related to emotions and agency. Conversely, presence with flat screens meant familiarity and control. Moreover, PST major was a predictor of presence, suggesting that 360 videos should be personalized according to PST career and professional goals. Finally, the interaction effect of preparing to teach K-12 mathematics and wearing a head-mounted display had a negative and statistically significant effect on participants' perceived presence, thus indicating a non-cumulative effect. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic 360 videos are increasingly used to support preservice teacher training. 360 videos for teacher education foster immersion, presence, and noticing skills. What this paper adds Empirical evidence that 360 videos experienced with head-mounted display facilitate agency and emotional involvement. Empirical evidence that 360 videos experienced with flat screens facilitate feelings of control. Data showed that preservice teachers' content area (math) was a positive predictor of presence in 360 videos. Implications for practice and/or policy Head-mounted displays show promise as a delivery mode for 360 videos in teacher education. 360 videos should be personalized according to PST career and professional goals. The eXtended Reality Presence Scale is confirmed as a robust instrument to measure presence in immersive environments. More research is needed to evaluate the scalability of this approach in other contexts.},

	abstract = {Recently, alternate reality games (ARGs) have been applied in museum learning to encourage learners' active engagement through playful problem-solving activities. However, most learners have insufficient prior knowledge and metacognitive skills to complete the learning tasks in such games. To support learning with ARGs, there is a need to provide proper feedback so that the learners are capable of self-regulated learning and solving the problems encountered during the learning process. Considering the influences of individual differences, this research developed a chatbot as a learning partner in ARG-based learning to support students’ learning with adaptive feedback in a museum. A quasi-experimental study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness with and without the proposed approach. The results showed that the AI-based chatbot approach could significantly improve learners' metacognition awareness, emotional engagement and behavioural engagement. Besides, it is helpful to facilitate students' double-loop learning.Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Alternate reality games (ARGs) enable students to interact with real-world contexts. The complexities of real contexts and ambiguities of the ARGs could frustrate students and demotivate their engagement in problem-solving activities. Conventional corrected feedback may fail to match individual students' requirements in solving encountered problems. What this paper adds An AI-based chatbot was designed as a smart learning partner to support the students in solving encountered problems. The experimental results showed that the proposed approach improved students' metacognitive awareness and engagement. A drawing analysis and a behaviour sequential analysis were applied to further examine the students' perceptions and behavioural patterns. Implications for practice and/or policy It is potentially worth integrating AI-based chatbots into game-based learning to promote students' metacognitive awareness and engagement. AI-based chatbots provide adaptive feedback to effectively facilitate students' self-regulated learning and double-loop learning.},

	abstract = {This descriptive study focuses on using voice activity detection (VAD) algorithms to extract student speech data in order to better understand the collaboration of small group work and the impact of teaching assistant (TA) interventions in undergraduate engineering discussion sections. Audio data were recorded from individual students wearing head-mounted noise-cancelling microphones. Video data of each student group were manually coded for collaborative behaviours (eg, group task relatedness, group verbal interaction and group talk content) of students and TA–student interactions. The analysis includes information about the turn taking, overall speech duration patterns and amounts of overlapping speech observed both when TAs were intervening with groups and when they were not. We found that TAs very rarely provided explicit support regarding collaboration. Key speech metrics, such as amount of turn overlap and maximum turn duration, revealed important information about the nature of student small group discussions and TA interventions. TA interactions during small group collaboration are complex and require nuanced treatments when considering the design of supportive tools. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Student turn taking can provide information about the nature of student discussions and collaboration. Real classroom audio data of small groups typically have lots of background noise and present challenges for audio analysis. TAs have little training in how to productively intervene with students about collaborative skills. What this paper adds TA interaction with groups primarily focused on task progress and understanding of concepts with negligible explicit support on building collaborative skills. TAs intervened with the groups often which gave the students little time for uptake of their suggestions or deeper discussion. Student turn overlap was higher without the presence of TAs. Maximum turn duration can be an important real-time turn metric to identify the least verbally active student participant in a group. Implications for practice and/or policy TA training should include information about how to monitor groups for collaborative behaviours and when and how they should intervene to provide feedback and support. TA feedback systems should keep track of previous interventions by TAs (especially in contexts where there are multiple TAs facilitating) and the duration since previous intervention to ensure that TAs do not intervene with a group too frequently with little time for student uptake. Maximum turn duration could be used as a real-time metric to identify the least verbally active student in a group so that support could be provided to them by the TAs.},

	abstract = {Upvotes serve important purposes in online social annotation environments. However, limited studies have explored the influential factors affecting peer upvoting in online collaborative learning. In this study, we analysed the factors influencing students' upvotes received from their peers as 91 participants utilized Perusall, an online social annotation system, for collaborative reading. The participants were asked to collaboratively annotate 29 reading materials in a semester. We collected student reading behaviours and analysed their annotations with a text-mining tool of Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC). Moreover, conditional inference tree was used to determine the relative importance of explanatory factors to the upvotes students received. The results showed that the high-upvote group made significantly more annotations, posted more responses to others' annotations and displayed fewer negative emotions in annotations than those who did not receive upvotes. The two groups of students had no significant differences in the upvotes given to others, as well as cognitive activities and positive emotions involved in annotations. Moreover, the number of annotations was the determining factor in predicting the upvotes that one could receive in social annotation activities. This study has significant practical implications regarding providing interventions in social annotation-based collaborative reading.Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Social annotations enhance students' reading experience, facilitate knowledge sharing and collaboration, promote high-quality learning interactions and ultimately lead to improved performance. In social annotation environments, receiving upvotes from peers is not only a type of feedback but also a form of motivation, social interaction and social validation. No study has explored the influential factors in peer upvoting within social annotation-based learning. What this paper adds This study was the first to examine social annotations through the lens of the community of inquiry framework. We investigated the relationships between students' cognitive and social presence in their annotations and the upvotes they received in an online social annotation environment. Our study revealed the strategies for obtaining upvotes from peers in social annotation-based learning environments. Implications for practice and/or policy The high-upvote group made significantly more annotations, posted more responses to others' annotations and displayed fewer negative emotions in annotations compared to the low-upvote group. The two groups of students did not show significant differences in the upvotes they gave to others or in the cognitive activities and positive emotions involved in annotations. The number of annotations was the primary factor predicting the number of upvotes received in the collaborative reading.

	abstract = {In this study, we integrated corpus technology in pre-service TESOL (Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages) teachers' technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) development in corpus technology, termed corpus-based language pedagogy (CBLP), and highlighted the collaborative effort for knowledge building among participants for TPACK development. The study examined the role of online collaboration in facilitating how pre-service TESOL teachers developed their CBLP (TPACK in corpus technology) using a learning-by-design approach, enacted it in co-designing lessons, revised their lessons and reflected on their collective knowledge building processes. Using a case study approach involving 33 participants, the study focused on both intra- and inter-group interactions to understand the pre-service teachers' learning dynamics/changes and unpack the interaction mechanism involved in online collaborative learning. To these ends, we collected data including CBLP group lesson designs, intra-group data (interviews) and inter-group peer critical comments and analysed them based on the two stages (comprehension and transformation) of Shulman's pedagogical reasoning. The results suggest that engaging in online collaboration, facilitated by the learning-by-design approach, is instrumental in enabling pre-service teachers to learn corpus technology and expand their repertoire of teaching strategies. Our findings imply that both intra- and inter-group collaboration modes are important to help pre-service TESOL teachers holistically develop TPACK for language teaching. Similar implications may be applied to other subject-specific TPACK training.Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Teacher preparation programmes play a crucial role in developing pre-service teachers' technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge (TPACK) TPACK integration into pedagogical practice and subject-specific professional development opportunities are important for effective teaching, but there is a lack of research on subject-specific TPACK development (eg, TPACK in language teaching) Online collaborative learning can support TPACK development, but most studies focused on intra-group interactions with little attention to inter-group interactions What this paper adds Introduces a new corpus-based language pedagogy (CBLP) for TESOL teachers to help them develop TPACK in language teaching Presents an innovative two-step training framework for developing TESOL teachers' TPACK in corpus technology Examines the role of online collaboration in developing pre-service TESOL teachers' TPACK for teaching with corpus technology through learning by design Provides in-depth qualitative data analysed both qualitatively and quantitatively to investigate the specific roles that intra-group and inter-group interactions play in shaping pre-service TESOL teachers' CBLP development Develops an analytical framework comprising nine categories (under the comprehension and transformation stages of Shulman's pedagogical reasoning model) to code pre-service TESOL teachers' TPACK development in corpus technology Finds that intra-group interactions facilitate both comprehension and transformation stages, while inter-group interactions predominantly facilitate the transformation stage of CBLP Implications for practice Emphasises hands-on corpus-searching skills and guidance on browsing corpora when designing CBLP lessons Encourages both within-group and between-group interactions in online collaborative learning to foster TPACK development for using corpus technology in teaching language subjects Considers incorporating similar approaches for developing other subject-specific TPACK for other teaching subjects},

	abstract = {This study investigates a virtual reality (VR) cross-cultural interactive learning environment that combines a 360-degree video camera for content creation, a viewing tool, and a video conference platform for real-time interaction. This environment aims to address the limitations of traditional 360-degree VR tools, particularly in enabling simultaneous, interactive engagement among multiple users. The study recruited 31 university students from China and Indonesia utilizing convenience sampling to test the efficacy of the environment in fostering cognitive development and challenging cross-cultural stereotypes. The methodology included analysing student-created content, questionnaire responses, and insights from semistructured interviews. The analysis, grounded in a cognitive development taxonomy and an assessment of stereotype changes, revealed that the students reached the “remember” and “understand” cognitive levels. Additionally, prevalent stereotypes held by the students were addressed. The immersive nature of the VR environment and the interactions with foreign peers were highly appreciated, significantly contributing to cognitive growth and stereotype mitigation. These findings offer valuable insights for educators and researchers in technology-assisted cross-cultural education, emphasizing the importance of designing interactive VR-based activities that effectively facilitate cognitive development and address cross-cultural stereotypes.Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Telecollaborative projects have been widely implemented to facilitate intercultural learning. Scholars have employed 360-degree video technology to develop virtual reality (VR) learning environments. 360-degree videos offer a panoramic view of different cultures, enabling learners to explore and interact with their surroundings, thus fostering contextualized learning experiences. Such videos can enhance student engagement, motivation, and learning effectiveness. What this paper contributes The existing 360-degree video technology offers only a restricted range of learning scenarios, especially in terms of the capability to enable multiple students to watch virtual reality (VR) content using head-mounted displays (HMDs) and engage in real-time interactions simultaneously. To overcome this limitation, we developed a virtual reality (VR) cross-cultural interactive learning environment. Our solution includes a 360-degree video viewing tool with which students can watch the created content, along with an online video conference platform that facilitates the observation of each other's viewed content through their HMDs, and enables real-time communication among students to discuss the content they are experiencing. Implications for practice or policy The integration of our VR interactive learning environment into cross-cultural learning creates authentic and immersive learning environments that provide students with a realistic sense of presence. This enhances cross-cultural learning by making objects, people, and situations appear lifelike. Our technological approach fosters interaction among students from diverse geographical and cultural backgrounds within virtual reality learning environments. Students can not only receive information about the target culture but also exchange culture-related information and communicate in real time. Since our approach is convenient and autonomous, it holds immense potential for resolving the common challenges faced by teachers and students in cross-cultural teaching and learning.},

	abstract = {This study addresses the need for inclusive AI education by focusing on marginalized female students who historically lack access to learning opportunities in computing. It applies the theoretical framework of intersectionality to understand how gender, race and ethnicity intersect to shape these students' learning experiences and outcomes. Specifically, this study investigated 27 high-school students' cognitive engagement in machine learning practices. We conducted the Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test to explore differences in cognitive engagement between marginalized female students and their peers, employed comparative content analysis to delve into significant differences and analysed interview data thematically to gain deeper insights into students' machine learning model development processes. The findings indicated that, when engaging in machine learning practices requiring drawing diverse cultural perspectives, marginalized female students demonstrated significantly higher performance compared to their peers. In particular, marginalized female students exhibited strengths in holistic language analysis, paying attention to writers' intentions and recognizing cultural nuances in language. This study suggests that integrating language analysis and machine learning across subjects has the potential to empower marginalized female students and amplify their perspectives. Furthermore, it calls for a strengths-based approach to reshape the narrative of underrepresentation and promote equitable participation in machine learning and AI. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Female students, particularly those from underrepresented groups such as African American and Latina students, often experience low levels of cognitive engagement in computing. Marginalized female students possess unique strengths that, when nurtured, have the potential to not only transform their own learning experiences but also contribute to the advancement of the computing field. It is critical to empower marginalized female students in K-12 AI (ie, a subfield of computing) education, seeking to bridge the gender and racial disparity in AI. What this paper adds Marginalized female students outperformed their peers in responding to machine learning questions related to feature analysis and feature distribution interpretation. When responding to these questions, they demonstrated a holistic approach to analysing language by considering interactions between features and writers' intentions. They drew on knowledge about how language was used to convey meaning in different cultural contexts. Implications for practice and/or policy Educators should design learning environments that encourage students to draw upon their cultural backgrounds, linguistic insights and diverse experiences to enhance their engagement and performance in AI-related activities. Educators should strategically integrate language analysis and machine learning across different subjects to create interdisciplinary learning experiences that support students' exploration of the interplay among language, culture and AI. Educational institutions and policy initiatives should adopt a strengths-based approach that focuses on empowering marginalized female students by acknowledging their inherent abilities and diverse backgrounds.},

A systematic review was conducted to provide an overview of what, why and how SCEDs are used to evaluate ℡. Accordingly, 136 studies from nine databases fulfilling the inclusion criteria were included. The results showed that most of the studies were conducted in the field of special education focusing on evaluating the effectiveness of computer-assisted instructions, video prompts and mobile devices to improve language and communication, socio-emotional, skills and mental health. The research objective of most studies was to evaluate the effects of the intervention; often no specific justification for using SCED was provided. Additionally, multiple baseline and phase designs were the most common SCED types, with most measurements in the intervention phase. Frequent data collection methods were observation, tests, questionnaires and task analysis, whereas, visual and descriptive analysis were common methods for data analysis.

	abstract = {In the ever-evolving AI-driven education, integrating AI technologies into teaching practices has become increasingly imperative for aspiring STEM educators. Yet, there remains a dearth of studies exploring pre-service STEM teachers' readiness to incorporate AI into their teaching practices. This study examined the factors influencing teachers' willingness to integrate AI (WIAI), especially from the perspective of pre-service STEM teachers' attitudes towards the application of AI in teaching. In the study, a comprehensive survey was conducted among 239 pre-service STEM teachers, examining the influences and interconnectedness of Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK), Perceived Usefulness (PU), Perceived Ease of Use (PE), and Self-Efficacy (SE) on WIAI. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was employed for data analysis. The findings illuminated direct influences of TPACK, PU, PE, and SE on WIAI. TPACK was found to directly affect PE, PU, and SE, while PE and PU also directly influenced SE. Further analysis revealed significant mediating roles of PE, PU, and SE in the relationship between TPACK and WIAI, highlighting the presence of a chain mediation effect. In light of these insights, the study offers several recommendations on promoting pre-service STEM teachers' willingness to integrate AI into their teaching practices. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic? The potential of AI technologies to enrich learning experiences and improve outcomes in STEM education has been recognized. Pre-service teachers' willingness to integrate AI into teaching practice is crucial for shaping the future learning environment. The TAM and TPACK frameworks are used to analyse teacher factors in technology-supported learning environments. Few studies have been conducted for examining factors of pre-service teachers' willingness to integrate AI into teaching practices in the context of STEM education. What this paper adds? A survey was designed and developed for exploring pre-service STEM teachers' WIAI and its relationships with factors including TPACK, PE, PU, and SE. TPACK, SE, PU, and PE have direct impact on pre-service STEM teachers' WIAI. SE, PU, and PE have been identified as mediating variables in the relationship between TPACK and WIAI. Two sequential mediation effects, TPACK → PE → SE → WIAI and TPACK → PU → SE → WIAI, among pre-service STEM teachers were further identified. Implications of this study for practice and/or policy Pre-service STEM teachers are encouraged to explore and utilize AI technology to enhance their confidence and self-efficacy in integrating AI into teaching practices. Showcasing successful cases and practical experiences is essential for fostering awareness of AI integration in STEM education. It is recommended to introduce AI education courses in teacher training programs. Offering internship and practicum opportunities related to AI technologies can enhance their practical skills in integrating AI into education.},

	abstract = {Gamification, characterized by the integration of game design elements into non-game environments, has gained popularity in classrooms due to its potential for increased engagement and enjoyment compared to traditional lecture-based teaching methods. While students generally exhibit positive attitudes towards gamification, its impact on academic achievement remains a subject of debate. This study employed a meta-analysis approach to examine the overall influence of gamification on students' academic performance. The sample comprised 22 experimental studies conducted between 2008 and 2023, comparing the effects of gamified and non-gamified classes. Utilizing a random effects model, the results revealed a moderately positive effect of gamification on student academic performance (Hedges's g = 0.782, p {\textless} 0.05). The paper further discussed the outcomes of various moderator analyses, providing valuable insights into the selection and utilization of game design elements, as well as considerations specific to different educational stages.Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Most research has consistently demonstrated that gamification has a positive impact on students' achievement. The current state of review research is not sufficiently comprehensive. There is a lack of meta-analyses exploring the diverse impacts of gamification. What this paper adds The effect of factors such as geographical regions, education levels, learning environments, subjects and game elements on gamification was examined. The study revealed a significant and positive impact of gamification on students' achievement across various factors, including geographical regions, education levels, learning environments, subjects and game elements. Implications for practice and/or policy Gamification represents a prudent choice for teachers seeking to enhance students' achievement. Teachers are suggested to adopt and employ appropriate game elements in their instructional approaches. Future research could focus on investigating the impact of feedback as a game element in teaching and learning.},

	abstract = {There is a global trend in the increased adoption of e-assessment in school classrooms to enhance learning. Teachers, as classroom-based assessment designers and implementers, play a vital role in such assessment change. However, little is known about school teachers' classroom-based e-assessment practices and the underlying reasons. To address this research gap, this study identified the factors influencing Hong Kong primary school teachers' e-assessment practices underpinned by the theory of planned behaviour (TPB). A large-scale survey was issued to 878 teachers via Qualtrics. Structural equation modelling (SEM) analysis shows that primary school teachers' intentions of using e-assessment and perceived behavioural control of it were the two strongest factors predicting their e-assessment practices in a general way. Specifically, teachers' intentions outweighed perceived behavioural control in determining their use of alternative e-assessment tasks and e-feedback, but this reversed for e-tests/exercises. The impact of perceived behavioural control was consistent across the three types of e-assessment practices. Furthermore, teachers' attitudes significantly influenced their intentions to use alternative e-assessment tasks, while subject norms primarily predicted their intentions to use e-feedback. The findings have implications for primary schools to take countermeasures to facilitate the successful implementation of e-assessment at the classroom level.Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic E-assessment has the potential to influence learning. E-assessment has often been used in a controlled environment with a relatively small sample size. The past 3 years have seen a surge in discussions and research around using e-assessment in classroom settings, mostly in higher education. What this paper adds Primary school teachers used more e-tests or exercises than alternative e-assessment tasks and e-feedback in their daily teaching. Teachers' intentions outweighed perceived behavioural control in determining their use of alternative e-assessment tasks and e-feedback, but this reversed for e-tests/exercises. Teachers' attitudes significantly influenced their intentions to use alternative e-assessment tasks, while subject norms primarily predicted their intentions to use e-feedback. Implications for practice and/or policy Teachers' intentions of using alternative e-assessment and e-feedback should be increased to enhance their usage in the classroom. Teachers' e-assessment literacy should be developed to enable them to integrate e-assessment into their daily instruction.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a Human-Centred Learning Analytics (HCLA) design approach for developing learning analytics (LA) dashboards for K-12 classrooms that maintain both contextual relevance and scalability—two goals that are often in competition. Using mixed methods, we collected observational and interview data from teacher partners and assessment data from their students' engagement with the lesson materials. This DBR-based, human-centred design process resulted in a dashboard that supported teachers in addressing their students' learning needs. To develop the dashboard features that could support teachers, we found that a design refinement process that drew on the insights of teachers with varying teaching experience, philosophies and teaching contexts strengthened the resulting outcome. The versatile nature of the approach, in terms of student learning outcomes, makes it useful for HCLA design efforts across diverse K-12 educational contexts. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Learning analytics that are aligned to both a learning theory and learning design support student learning. LA dashboards that support users to understand the associated learning analytics data provide actionable insight. Design-based research is a promising methodology for Human-Centred Learning Analytics design, particularly in the K-12 educational context. What this paper adds Leveraging a longstanding, yet fluid, research-practice partnership is an effective design-based research adaptation for addressing the high variation in instructional practices that characterize K-12 education. Using both quantitative and qualitative data that reflects students' developing knowledge effectively supports teachers' inquiry into student learning. Teachers' use of learning analytics dashboards is heavily influenced by their perspectives on teaching and learning. Implications for practice and/or policy Impact on student learning outcomes, alongside usability and feasibility, should be included as a necessary metric for the effectiveness of LA design. LA dashboard developers should both leverage learning data that reflect students' developing knowledge and position teachers to take responsive pedagogical action to support student learning. LA researchers and developers should utilize a long-term, yet fluid, research-practice partnership to form a multi-stakeholder, multidisciplinary design team for Human-Centred Learning Analytics design.},

	abstract = {High attrition/dropout rates and low engagement have been major concerns of online educators. This study examined female high school students' cognitive engagement and disengagement in an online learning context during the COVID-19 pandemic through the lens of self-determination theory's basic psychological needs. We investigated an extended dual-process motivation mediation model that emphasizes the mediating role of the need for competence, including an additional factor, technology self-efficacy, in a South Korean high school context (n = 235). Results from structural equation modelling provided evidence for the proposed model. Our findings indicated that the exogenous variables (ie, perceived autonomy support, perceived teacher control and technology self-efficacy) predicted cognitive engagement and disengagement with the mediating role of competence need satisfaction and competence need frustration. We found distinct processes including (a) “autonomy support-competence need satisfaction-cognitive engagement”, (b) “teacher control-competence need frustration-cognitive disengagement”, (c) “technology self-efficacy-competence need satisfaction-cognitive engagement” and (d) “technology self-efficacy-competence need frustration (negative effect)-cognitive disengagement”. This study suggests using autonomy support strategies to fulfil students' competence needs in online learning contexts. We also found a possible role of technology self-efficacy in influencing psychological competence needs, cognitive engagement and cognitive disengagement in online learning contexts. Implications of the findings are discussed. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic High attrition/dropout rates and low engagement have been major concerns of online educators. Emergency remote teaching (ERT) has implications for online teaching beyond the ERT paradigm. Self-determination theory (SDT) has been adopted and adapted with the goal of determining how to achieve need satisfaction, optimize learner motivation and enhance student engagement in classroom settings. What this paper adds This study applied a dual-process motivation mediation model to investigate both cognitive engagement and disengagement among female high school students in an ERT online learning environment. The extended dual-process motivation mediation model examined the role of an additional factor, technology self-efficacy in cognitive engagement and disengagement in online learning. This study examined the role of direct, indirect and cross-over effects focusing on both bright and dark aspects of the dual-process motivation mediation model in online learning in a South Korean girls' high school during ERT. Implications for practice and/or policy This study proposes the use of autonomy support strategies in online learning contexts. Teachers should understand their students and provide support that addresses competence need satisfaction to enhance student cognitive engagement in online learning contexts. More efforts should be made to prepare teachers for designing online learning experiences that increase students' competence need satisfaction and decrease competence need frustration.},

	abstract = {Children with neurodevelopmental disorders often have social–emotional difficulties. Serious games can be used to support their social–emotional learning. This study investigated if 6–10-year-old children with autism spectrum condition, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and developmental language disorder would improve their emotion discrimination skills by playing a serious game. Intervention (n = 30) and control groups (n = 20), comprising children with neurodevelopmental disorders, and a group of typically developing (TD) age peers (n = 106), completed six emotion discrimination tasks. ABA research design was applied in this study. Prior to the game intervention, children with neurodevelopmental disorders were significantly delayed in relation to their TD age peers in all tasks. After playing the game for two months, the children in the intervention group had significantly improved their emotion discrimination skills in four tasks, whereas the control group had significantly advanced in only one task without practice. Intervention gains were maintained at the one-month follow-up. Parents reported that the children in the intervention group somewhat improved their emotion recognition and behavioural skills in daily life in comparison to the control group. Implications for practice are discussed. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Children with neurodevelopmental disorders often exhibit various social–emotional symptoms. Within the field of social–emotional learning, many serious games have a narrow focus on specific skills, and they often only provide possibilities for observing target behaviours, not actual skill training. There are mixed results on the efficacy of game-based interventions targeted at improving social–emotional skills. What this paper adds The Emotion Detectives game used in this study offers a well-designed learning environment that provides adaptive learning and feedback systems. The participating children's social–emotional skills were assessed with versatile methods and via triangulation. Intervention with the Emotion Detectives game helped to decrease some emotion and behavioural symptoms of the players. Implications for practice This study provides information about the efficacy of a web-based game that is freely available for supporting children's social–emotional learning. Improvements in emotion discrimination and recognition, as well as behavioural skills, can be gained by playing serious games. For optimal intervention outcomes, multimodal training should be utilized in serious games targeting social–emotional learning.},

	abstract = {People in modern society are media multitaskers due to portable devices and omnipresent wireless networks, and college students are no exception. Previous studies have indicated that students' media multitasking behaviours in class harm their academic performances, and understanding the reasons for college students' engagement in such behaviour is meaningful. However, the literature takes media multitasking behaviour as an audience behaviour, which ignores the interaction between students and their surroundings. This study fills this gap by emphasizing the role of the social learning process. A survey was conducted in a public and comprehensive university in western China, and a total of 457 valid respondents were obtained. The results from PLS-SEM revealed that college students' in-class media multitasking behaviours were influenced by both observational learning (ie, imitating others) and reinforcement learning (ie, in-class interventions), and this learning process was shaped by students' media multitasking self-efficacy and self-management of learning. These findings contribute to the current literature by providing a relatively new perspective for understanding college students' in-class media multitasking behaviours, and suggestions about how to deal with such behaviours are also provided. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic In-class media multitasking behaviours (ICMMBs) damage college students' academic performance. College students' ICMMBs are affected by individual factors, such as internet addiction and sensation seeking. Social learning theory is widely adopted as a general theoretical background to explain those behaviours of which possible consequences are easily observed no matter from others or from individuals themselves. What this paper adds This work enriches the media multitasking literature by investigating the predictors of ICMMBs from a relatively new perspective, that is, the social learning perspective. This work also contributes to the literature on media multitasking by examining how the social learning process of college students' ICMMBs differs across students. This work extends the application scope of social learning theory to the context of college students' ICMMBs. Implications for practice and/or policy. The role of imitating others proves the importance of the learning atmosphere in classrooms, so teachers or lecturers should pay special attention to build a learning atmosphere away from ICMMBs. Some in-class interventions should be established, especially the formal policy of schools to require students to hand in their smartphones or other media before class and students' own mindfulness of such behaviour. Teachers or lecturers should take actions to lower the academic performance expectations of students with higher media multitasking self-efficacy (MMSE) because students with higher MMSE often overestimate their capabilities to have good performance when conducting other tasks simultaneously.},

	abstract = {Formative assessment is essential for improving teaching and learning, and AI and visualization techniques provide great potential for its design and delivery. Using NLP, cognitive diagnostic and visualization techniques designed to analyse and present students' monthly exam data, we developed an AI-enabled visual report tool comprising six modules and conducted an empirical study of its effectiveness in a high school biology classroom. A total of 125 students in a ninth-grade biology course were assigned to a treatment group (n = 63) receiving AI-enabled visual reports as the intervention and a control group (n = 62) receiving overall oral feedback from the teacher. We present the main statistical results of the within-subjects design and the between-subjects design respectively, to better capture the main findings. Repeated measures ANOVA revealed a significant interaction effect of intervention and time on learning achievement, and the paired-sample Wilcoxon test indicated that the treatment group had experienced increasing learning anxiety (Cohen's d = 0.203, p = 0.046) and self-efficacy (Cohen's d = 1.793, p = 0.000) over time. Moreover, we conducted a series of non-parametric tests to compare the effects of AI-enabled visual reports and teacher feedback, but found no significant differences except for an increased self-efficacy (Cohen's d = 0.312, p = 0.046). Additionally, we had the students in the treatment group rate their favourable modules in the AI-enabled visual report and provide evaluative feedback. The study results provide important insights into the design and implementation of effective formative assessment supported by artificial AI and visualization techniques. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Formative assessment is essential for improving teaching and learning. Traditional formative assessment tools lack accurate data-oriented assessment and usability. AI and visualization techniques have great potential for formative assessment. What this paper adds This study designs and implements an AI-enabled visual report tool that generates data-driven, user-friendly reports. The AI-enabled visual report can not only enhance students' learning achievement and self-regulated learning over time but also increase their test anxiety. The AI-enabled visual report has a comparable effect with teacher feedback but leads to increased self-efficacy. Implications for practice and/or policy We recommend using the AI-enabled visual report in large-size classes for its overall positive effects on both learning achievement and self-regulated learning. We recommend using the AI-enabled visual report over teacher feedback for its capacity to enhance students' self-efficacy. We recommend prioritizing the modules of Performance Ranking, Personal Mastery and Knowledge Alert when designing the AI-enabled visual report.},

	abstract = {Background: Previous research results suggest that ADHD symptoms explain the relationship between specific learning disability and externalising psychopathology and between math disability and anxiety, but not between reading disability and anxiety. For depression, previous results are mixed. Aims: The current study aims to clarify this role of ADHD symptoms in the relationship between various areas of academic achievement (reading, writing, and math skills) and psychopathological symptoms (anxiety, depression, and conduct disorder). Methods and Procedures: We used linear regressions based on data from a general population sample (N= 3,014) collected using online assessment of 3rd and 4th grade students in Germany, which included measures of academic achievement and parent-reported psychopathological symptoms. Outcomes and Results: ADHD symptoms completely account for the relationship between reading/writing achievement and anxiety and between writing/math achievement and conduct problems. The negative relationship between academic achievement and depression was strongest for children with average or high ADHD symptom scores. Conclusions and Implications: ADHD symptoms play an important role in explaining the relationship between academic achievement and psychopathological symptoms in elementary school children. The nature and size of this role depend on the exact constructs under study. We discuss implications for the support of children with learning problems, ADHD, and/or psychopathological problems.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The health care system is undergoing a shift toward a more patient-centered approach for individuals with chronic and complex conditions, which presents a series of challenges, such as predicting hospital needs and optimizing resources. At the same time, the exponential increase in health data availability has made it possible to apply advanced statistics and artificial intelligence techniques to develop decision-support systems and improve resource planning, diagnosis, and patient screening. These methods are key to automating the analysis of large volumes of medical data and reducing professional workloads.
OBJECTIVE: This article aims to present a machine learning model and a case study in a cohort of patients with highly complex conditions. The object was to predict mortality within the following 4 years and early mortality over 6 months following diagnosis. The method used easily accessible variables and health care resource utilization information.
METHODS: A classification algorithm was selected among 6 models implemented and evaluated using a stratified cross-validation strategy with k=10 and a 70/30 train-test split. The evaluation metrics used included accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve.
RESULTS: The model predicted patient death with an 87\% accuracy, recall of 87\%, precision of 82\%, F1-score of 84\%, and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.88 using the best model, the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) classifier. The results were worse when predicting premature deaths (following 6 months) with an 83\% accuracy (recall=55\%, precision=64\% F1-score=57\%, and AUC=0.88) using the Gradient Boosting (GRBoost) classifier.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showcases encouraging outcomes in forecasting mortality among patients with intricate and persistent health conditions. The employed variables are conveniently accessible, and the incorporation of health care resource utilization information of the patient, which has not been employed by current state-of-the-art approaches, displays promising predictive power. The proposed prediction model is designed to efficiently identify cases that need customized care and proactively anticipate the demand for critical resources by health care providers.},

	abstract = {Deep learning (DL) based methods have been extensively studied for medical image segmentation, mostly emphasizing the design and training of DL networks. Only few attempts were made on developing methods for applying DL models in test time. In this paper, we study whether a given off-the-shelf segmentation network can be stably improved on-the-fly during test time in an online processing-and-learning fashion. We propose a new online test-time method, called TestFit, to improve results of a given off-the-shelf DL segmentation model in test time by actively fitting the test data distribution. TestFit first creates a supplementary network (SuppNet) from the given trained off-the-shelf segmentation network (this original network is referred to as OGNet) and applies SuppNet together with OGNet for test time inference. OGNet keeps its hypothesis derived from the original training set to prevent the model from collapsing, while SuppNet seeks to fit the test data distribution. Segmentation results and supervision signals (for updating SuppNet) are generated by combining the outputs of OGNet and SuppNet on the fly. TestFit needs only one pass on each test sample - the same as the traditional test model pipeline - and requires no training time preparation. Since it is challenging to look at only one test sample and no manual annotation for model update each time, we develop a series of technical treatments for improving the stability and effectiveness of our proposed online test-time training method. TestFit works in a plug-and-play fashion, requires minimal hyper-parameter tuning, and is easy to use in practice. Experiments on a large collection of 2D and 3D datasets demonstrate the capability of our TestFit method.},

While gesture's importance in conveying shared meaning is recognized, its role in collaborative group settings remains understudied. This gap hinders accurate and equitable assessment and instruction, particularly for linguistically diverse students. Advancements in multimodal learning analytics, leveraging sensor technologies, offer innovative solutions for capturing and analysing body movements. This study employs these novel approaches to demonstrate how learners' machine-­ detected body movements during the learning process relate to their verbal and nonverbal contributions to the co-­construction of embodied math knowledge. These findings substantiate the feasibility of utilizing learners' machine-­detected body movements as a valid indicator for inferring their engagement with the collaborative knowledge construction process. In addition, we empirically validate that these inferred different levels of learner engagement indeed impact the desired learning outcomes of the intervention.

	abstract = {Purpose  Many health professions education programs involve people with lived experience as expert speakers. Such presentations may help learners better understand the realities of living with chronic illness or experiencing an acute health problem. However, lectures from only one or a small number of people may not adequately illustrate the perspectives and experiences of a diverse patient cohort. Additionally, logistical constraints such as public health restrictions or travel barriers may impede in-person presentations, particularly among people who have more restrictions on their time. Health professions education programs may benefit from understanding the potential effects of online patient-led presentations with a diverse set of speakers. We aimed to explore whether patient-led online learning modules about diabetes care would influence learners’ responses to clinical scenarios and to collect learners’ feedback about the modules. Method  This within-subjects randomized experiment involved 26 third-year medical students at Université Laval in Quebec, Canada. Participation in the experiment was an optional component within a required course. Prior to the intervention, participating learners responded to three clinical scenarios randomly selected from a set of six such scenarios. Each participant responded to the other three scenarios after the intervention. The intervention consisted of patient-led online learning modules incorporating segments of narratives from 21 patient partners (11 racialized or Indigenous) describing why and how clinicians could provide patient-centered care. Working with clinical teachers and psychometric experts, we developed a scoring grid based on the biopsychosocial model and set 0.6 as a passing score. Independent evaluators, blinded to whether each response was collected before or after the intervention, then scored learners’ responses to scenarios using the grid. We used Fisher’s Exact test to compare proportions of passing scores before and after the intervention.},

	abstract = {Objectives  Creating environmentally sustainable healthcare culture within the dental field requires embedding the content in the dental curriculum at the undergraduate level. This study aimed to explore the current awareness and drivers among dental students and educators regarding environmentally sustainable dentistry (ESD) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and identify barriers and enablers to embrace it.
Methods  A cross-sectional survey using online questionnaires was carried out in six undergraduate dental education institutes within the UAE. Data analysis included descriptive statistics.
Results  In total 153 students and 53 educators participated in the survey. Most students and educators were not aware of any ESD content in their curricula. However, the majority of educators were familiar with the concept of ESD, while students were mostly unfamiliar or slightly familiar. Nonetheless, students largely agreed on its importance and their interest in learning it, as they viewed it relevant to their future practice. Educators agreed that the dental profession has a responsibility to be environmentally friendly and expressed their desire in introducing ESD content into the curricula. Several barriers were reported such as lack of knowledge, curricula space, educational resources, and time. Meanwhile, enablers included providing ESD capacity building, training and resources.
Conclusions  There was no explicit presence of ESD content in the dental curricula in the UAE. Despite the lack of adequate awareness on this topic among educators and more so among students, they both had positive views towards incorporating ESD into dental curricula. Overall, this study highlighted the importance of promoting ESD in dental programs. Clinical significance: ESD is gradually becoming a critical aspect of modern oral healthcare system. It has been mandated in the dental curricula in several regions globally. Embedding ESD in the UAE dental curricula would have several benefits for the environment as well as the future of the dental profession in the region. The clinical significance includes, but not limited to, improved treatment outcomes; patients, students and staff health and well-being; reduced health risks, and cost savings.},

	abstract = {As Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to revolutionize education, the use of AI to complete online assessments poses a considerable challenge to assessment analytics. With a goal to support and improve the assessment process, assessment analytics involves deriving meaningful insights from assessment data related to student knowledge and instructional effectiveness. However, when students utilize machine learning to complete online assessments, the validity of assessment data as an accurate representation of student knowledge diminishes. This chapter explores the strategic use of online formative assessments to both enhance understanding of student knowledge and deter the inappropriate use of AI. While there is always a risk of academic dishonesty, online formative assessments offer a unique avenue for teachers to gather empirical evidence of student engagement, current comprehension, and critical thinking. By adopting the PICS framework for personalized, informal, constructivist, and short online formative assessments, educators can harness assessment analytics to gain valid and valuable insights into student knowledge. This approach facilitates proactive engagement with students who may be grappling with content and tempted to seek assistance from artificial intelligence, fostering meaningful conversations that aim to address learning challenges and promote academic integrity in online education.},

	abstract = {To support professional competence development in teacher education, learning environments should allow learners to engage with professional tasks. It is crucial for knowledge and skill transfer in such learning environments to real-life context that preservice teachers perceive the task as authentic. However, due to a lack of prior knowledge, novices may have difficulties in recognizing relevant elements of practice. It is thus assumed that different factors may guide their perception of task authenticity independently of the task that has to be mastered. Such factors could be, for example, overt design features of the learning environments on a physical level or the familiarity with the learning context and learning prerequisites, which act as important links for knowledge acquisition. In this study, preservice teachers’ perception of task authenticity is contrasted between two implementation types (video vs. role-play) of the same simulation aiming to foster diagnostic competence. The two types differ in approximating real-life practice concerning the professional task that has to be mastered. In an experimental, longitudinal study, N = 119 mathematics preservice teachers participated online in one type of the simulation four times during one semester (n = 66 video, n = 53 role-play). Perceived task authenticity was higher for the video simulation type and increased with repeated participation in the simulation independently of the implementation type. Further, preservice teachers’ task utility value positively influenced their perception of task authenticity. The results illustrate the role of learning prerequisites as well as familiarity with the task for novices’ perception. Also, they could be an initial indication that, depending on the level of learners’ professional development, the way of approximating real-life practice in simulations might influence the perception of task authenticity.},

Concurrently, it has been shown that high-information feedback has the largest effect sizes for learning outcomes and academic performance. The following chapter provides insights to an approach to provide formative feedback supported by artificial intelligence in distance learning, that does not analyze summative assessment data, but rather intends to guide students in their learning process towards the graded final assessment. Approaches that are using methods of artificial intelligence and learning analytics have in common that they need data to derivate senseful outcomes. But how can students’ behavior in online learning courses be measured, and which concrete clickstream entries can be used to calculate these measures? This contribution looks at indicators focusing on data for supporting metacognitive learning strategies and illustrates especially the process to extract measures of behavioral engagement from raw log data and its conversion into high-information feedback. The entire process is reflected in collaboration with lecturers to design a didactically guided, user-­ centered interface that supports student reflections towards improving their learning and assessment preparation. The pursued solution includes a dashboard in combination with a rule-based personalized feedback text, connecting engagement measures with additional information (e.g., learning material, techniques, etc.). The chapter will give insight into the interdisciplinary elaboration process of learning dashboards and scientifically based development of high-information feedback texts, beside a practical insight into data transformation for learning analytics.},

The potency of learning analytics rests on both understanding relational dynamics and demonstrating their generalisability and temporal stability—aspects often underexplored in the literature. Recognising the benefits of formative assessments with corresponding feedback in promoting short- and long-term learning outcomes, we implemented several course-specific online formative assessments in four different courses at the University of Bern, Switzerland. Through these assessments, we gathered data from various domains, including task-specific information, students’ learning behaviour, and their prior knowledge. Our analysis demonstrated substantial relationships between initial, formative, and summative assessments, alongside variables like attitude and effort, which were consistent across the different courses. Given the identified relationships and their consistency, learning analytics has the potential to significantly enhance the quality of tertiary education. Further, these findings emphasise the critical importance of leveraging learning analytics in educational institutions.},

	abstract = {Assessment is one of the essential components of effective learning and permeates the entire learning process. Although off-the-shelf and standardized tests are widely accepted for large-scale tests and classroom assessments, guiding learning and assessing learners’ progress is also needed. Advances in cognitive psychology have led to an in-depth understanding of how learners acquire and use knowledge. Researchers faced the challenges that determining how this information can be used following the purposes of the assessment although emerging technologies make it possible to capture complex performances. Frameworks include design principles to support educational assessments in online learning environments. In this context, there is a need for assessment designs that add the traces left by learners in technology-supported environments to the assessment process. The evidence-­ centered design (ECD) framework provides a conceptual design framework that supports a wide variety of assessment types. This study aims to: (a) provide an overview of the ECD and (b) provide an example of how the ECD is used for learning-­centered assessment design. This study’s purpose is to overcome the difficulties of designing new assessment forms, guide the emergence of new assessment approaches, mediate how assessment design should be suitable for the complex nature of learning, and use the data from learners in the context of assessment analytics holistically. A typical assessment design architecture will also require different experts to work collaboratively.},

	abstract = {The recent advances in educational technology enabled the development of solutions that collect and analyse data from learning scenarios to inform the decision-making processes. Research fields like Learning Analytics (LA) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) aim at supporting teaching and learning by using such solutions. However, their adoption in authentic settings is still limited, among other reasons, derived from ignoring the stakeholders’ needs, a lack of pedagogical contextualisation, and a low trust in new technologies. Thus, the research fields of Human-Centered LA (HCLA) and Human-Centered AI (HCAI) recently emerged, aiming to understand the active involvement of stakeholders in the creation of such proposals. This paper presents a systematic literature review of 47 empirical research studies on the topic. The results show that more than two-thirds of the papers involve stakeholders in the design of the solutions, while fewer papers involved them during the ideation and prototyping, and the majority do not report any evaluation. Interestingly, while multiple techniques were used to collect data (mainly interviews, focus groups and workshops), few papers explicitly mentioned the adoption of existing HC design guidelines. Further evidence is needed to show the real impact of HCLA/HCAI approaches (e.g., in terms of user satisfaction and adoption).},

This negative attitude can reduce the effectiveness of CSCL on the learning process and results. This study investigated the effect of group collaboration processes on students’ attitudes toward CSCL. The research was carried out on students studying at the education faculty of a state university and taking the information technologies II course with the CSCL method. During an academic term, students carried out their course applications as collaborative learning groups that they formed in line with their wishes using the CSCL method. The research was carried out on 209 students. Path analysis was carried out in the research. As a result of the research, it was seen that group atmosphere, transactive memory system, and social interaction space positively affected the positive attitude towards CSCL. In addition, it is seen that the negative attitude towards social interaction space CSCL has the opposite effect. According to the research findings, it can be said that taking measures to improve the group atmosphere, transactive memory system, and social interaction space in CSCL can positively affect the attitude.

However, when teaching interdisciplinary learning to junior undergraduate students, their limited disciplinary knowledge and underrepresentation of students from some disciplines can hinder their learning performance. ChatGPT’s ability to engage in human-like conversations and massive knowledge grounded in different disciplines holds promise in enriching undergraduate students with the disciplinary knowledge that they lack. In this exploratory study, we engaged 130 undergraduate students in a three-condition quasi-experiment to examine how ChatGPT influences their demonstrated and perceived interdisciplinary learning quality, as measured by their online posts and surveys, respectively. The content analysis results show that overall, students’ online posts could be coded into four interdisciplinary learning dimensions: diversity, disciplinary grounding, cognitive advancement, and integration. The means of the first three dimensions were close to the middle level (ranging from 0.708 to 0.897, and the middle level is 1), whereas the mean score of integration was relatively small (i.e., 0.229). Students under the ChatGPT condition demonstrated improved disciplinary grounding. Regarding their perceived interdisciplinary learning quality, we did not find significant differences across the three conditions in the pre- or post-surveys. The findings underscore ChatGPT’s ability to enhance students’ disciplinary grounding and the significance of further fostering their integration skills.},

                Dementia patients may have language barriers and decreased comprehension ability. Their family caregivers can feel frustrated when communicating with them. Poor communication hinders family caregivers from obtaining accurate health information about patients, and may also increase their emotional burden, affecting patient care quality. The present study developed a virtual reality‐based simulated communication training (VRSCT) system and applied it to a training course for family caregivers of dementia patients. It allowed family caregivers to simulate real‐world situations in a VR environment, experience the daily communication barriers and stress with dementia patients, and apply their acquired knowledge and skills to solve related problems. This study used a randomised control experimental design with mixed analysis methods. A total of 63 family caregivers were recruited and randomly divided into the experimental group (
                N
                 = 32) learning with the VRSCT system to interact with virtual dementia patients and practice communication skills, and the control group (
                N
                 = 31) using the traditional role‐playing method for practice. Quantitative data were analysed to determine participants' knowledge of dementia care, attitudes, communication confidence and skills. In addition, the qualitative method was used to analyse the participants' discussion records. The results showed that by using the VRSCT approach, participants significantly improved their knowledge of dementia care, attitudes, communication confidence and communication skills compared to the control group. In addition, participants reported that through the real‐time feedback of the VRSCT system, they could recognise their previous incorrect communication approach. As a result, they adjusted their communication strategies and increased their self‐confidence.

                        This study proposed a VR‐based simulated communication training (VRSCT) approach; moreover, seven dementia cases of different degrees of severity were designed in the VR system to enable family members to experience possible challenges of taking care of dementia patients they might encounter in their daily lives.
                      
                      
                        Each case in the VRSCT system has its unique symptoms and communication barriers. The learner in the story plays a caregiver, experiencing and solving the problems and challenges posed by the system.
                      
                      
                        The experimental results show that the proposed method improves learners' knowledge, attitudes, communication confidence, and communication skills related to dementia care.

                        Utilising VR training can amplify awareness and secure enhanced social support for dementia‐related challenges.
                      
                      
                        Using VRSCT, as governments and institutions recognise the effectiveness of VR training, they will provide more resources and promote its widespread application.},

              Universities, significantly impacted by the shift to online learning during pandemic, must critically evaluate their teaching methods and outcomes to enhance performance in the post‐pandemic era. However, there has been a limited examination of whether students achieved comparable levels in cognition and social interaction during the pandemic compared to traditional face‐to‐face learning. Addressing this gap, this exploratory study utilized a quasi‐experimental design to analyse and compare the learning performance and outcomes of two cohorts of students (totalling 45) in a 12‐week university course delivered through the computer‐supported collaborative learning (CSCL) approach, both during and after the pandemic. Employing quantitative analysis and lag sequential analysis, the study examined students' behaviours, similarities and differences in performance within CSCL environments under two distinct social situations. Results indicated that students engaged in complete online learning with CSCL and those in face‐to‐face teaching with CSCL achieved similar levels of conceptual understanding. Additionally, a comparable distribution pattern of learning behaviours was observed. However, significant differences in behaviour sequences emerged between the two implementations, with students exhibiting a higher level of engagement in CSCL activities during the post‐pandemic period. These findings inform the design of CSCL environments should integrate student‐centred activities and include guiding scripts, prompts and scaffoldings in navigating learning endeavours effectively.

                        The CSCL environment could facilitate teacher‐student and student–student interaction in learning activities.
                      
                      
                        Studies have been conducted on the impact of scripts and prompts on students' cognition and social interaction in CSCL environment.
                      
                      
                        There is a crucial need for conducting more in‐depth data analysis to comprehensively explore the CSCL process within university settings.
                      
                    
                  
                  
                    What this paper adds
                    
                      
                        A well‐designed CSCL environment, coupled with effective instructional strategies, exhibits resilience, sustaining its beneficial effects on students' academic performance and interaction.
                      
                      
                        Both cohorts demonstrated a proclivity for engaging in repetitive behaviours, particularly focused on reviewing and reading activities.
                      
                      
                        The latter cohort displayed a preference for individual tasks over collaborative efforts, showcasing a relatively higher frequency of individual work as opposed to group activities.
                      
                      
                        Notably absent in both groups were crucial behavioural sequences, namely VR‐IA and VC‐IA, underscoring potential areas for CSCL improvement.
                      
                    
                  
                  
                    Implications for practice and/or policy
                    
                      
                        In the CSCL environment, a variety of activities rooted in student‐centred pedagogy (ie, self‐regulated learning, inquiry‐based learning and peer feedback) should be seamlessly integrated.
                      
                      
                        It is recommended to furnish students with scripts, prompts and scaffoldings to bolster their navigation through collaborative and independent learning endeavours within CSCL environment.
                      
                      
                        Students are encouraged to bridge their newly acquired knowledge with their existing understanding, for enhancing engagement and promoting deeper comprehension.},

Online synchronous meeting tool, Zoom, and the asynchronous tool, Padlet, were used as online learning platforms. Data were collected using an 8-item questionnaire on the WTC and a 20-item questionnaire on the IP. They were pre-existing questionnaires developed for the Japanese context and were administered to 34 college students before and after their lessons. Participants’ speaking ability was tested twice (pre- and posttests). Open-ended responses and participant reflections were also analyzed to gain further insights. Results showed significant effects on enhancing WTC, IP and speaking skills of participants with regard to ICT-based International Interactions. In addition, positive communication experiences with cross-cultural partners using Zoom and Padlet led to higher affective aspects and learning motivation. The findings suggest the viability of Padlet and Zoom as a tool for all proficient learners because of their relative ease of use and data management features. The implication of this study is relevant to a pedagogical tool in online exchanges for the current generation of students.},

            This chapter introduces multi-channel sequence analysis, a novel method that examines two or more synchronised sequences. While this approach is relatively new in social sciences, its relevance to educational research is growing as researchers gain access to diverse multimodal temporal data. Throughout this chapter, we describe multi-channel sequence analysis in detail, with an emphasis on how to detect patterns within the sequences, i.e., clusters —or trajectories— of multi-channel sequences that share similar temporal evolutions (or similar trajectories). To illustrate this method we present a step-by-step tutorial in R that analyses students’ sequences of online engagement and academic achievement, exploring their longitudinal association. We cover two approaches for clustering multi-channel sequences: one based on using distance-based algorithms, and the other employing mixture hidden Markov models inspired by recent research.},

            Modeling a longitudinal process in educational research brings a lot of variability over time. The modeling procedure becomes even harder when using multivariate continuous variables, e.g., clicks on learning resources, time spent online, and interactions with peers. In fact, most human behavioral constructs are an amalgam of interrelated features with complex fluctuations over time. Modeling such processes requires a method that takes into account the multidimensional nature of the examined construct as well as the temporal evolution. In this chapter we describe the VaSSTra method, which combines person-based methods, sequence analysis and life-events methods. Throughout the chapter, we discuss how to derive states from different variables related to students, how to construct sequences from students’ longitudinal progression of states, and how to identify and study distinct trajectories of sequences that undergo a similar evolution. We also cover some advanced properties of sequences that can help us analyze and compare trajectories. We illustrate the method through a tutorial using the R programming language.},

            Sequence analysis is a data mining technique that is increasingly gaining ground in learning analytics. Sequence analysis enables researchers to extract meaningful insights from sequential data, i.e., to summarize the sequential patterns of learning data and classify those patterns into homogeneous groups. In this chapter, readers will become familiar with sequence analysis techniques and tools through real-life step-by-step examples of sequential trace log data of students’ online activities. Readers will be guided on how to visualize the common sequence plots and interpret such visualizations. An essential part of sequence analysis is the discovery of patterns within sequences through clustering techniques. Therefore, this chapter will demonstrate the various sequence clustering methods, calculator of cluster indices, and evaluation of clustering results.},

The barriers to participation and limitations of online learning are discussed along with such advantages as ﬂexibility in terms of location. This raises the question whether adult education providers can attract new participants with online courses—and whether people who have already been reached through on-site courses also take part online. The article then goes on to present a study in which participants in online courses (N = 1907) were surveyed about their choice of course. The focus was on public adult education centres (Volkshochschule, VHS), the largest adult education provider in Germany. Results showed, that almost half of the online participants could not be classiﬁed as belonging to the regular clientele of VHS. Regarding the decision to participate, the survey also showed that even regular VHS participants sometimes preferred an online course instead of a face-to-face course with the same content.},

	abstract = {This study applies Activity Theory to investigate how English as a foreign language (EFL) students prompt generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools during short story writing. Sixty-seven Hong Kong secondary school students created their own generative-AI tools using open-source language models and wrote short stories with them. The study collected and analyzed the students’ generative-AI tools, short stories, and written reflections on their conditions or purposes for prompting. The research identified three main themes regarding the purposes for which students’ prompt generative-AI tools during short story writing: a lack of awareness of purposes, overcoming writer’s block, and developing, expanding, and improving the story. The study also identified common characteristics of students’ activity systems, including the sophistication of their generative-AI tools, the quality of their stories, and their school’s overall academic achievement level, for their prompting of generative-AI tools for the three purposes during short story writing. The study’s findings suggest that teachers should be aware of students’ purposes for prompting generative-AI tools to provide tailored instructions and scaffolded guidance. The findings may also help designers provide differentiated instructions for users at various levels of story development when using a generative-AI tool.},

Previous research has shown that a responsive, dialogic feedback process that requires educators and students to engage in ongoing conversations can encourage student active engagement in feedback. However, it is challenging with larger student cohorts. Learning Analytics (LA) provides promising ways to facilitate timely feedback at scale by leveraging large datasets generated during students' learning. However, current LA design and implementation tend to treat feedback as a one-way transmission rather than a two-way process.},

This article examines the function of alternative assessment in structured learning activities with the goal of deconstructing their learning competence and fostering complex interaction. The research focuses on the relationship between numerous aspects and students’ online learning experiences, notably during the pandemic. An online survey was performed with 312 respondents who utilised the Blackboard online learning platform and a PLS-SEM analysis indicated that an alternative assessment mediated the relationship of learning readiness, student engagement, and student motivation toward student learning experience simultaneously. In conclusion, our study reinforces the vital need of addressing the mediator role of alternative assessment to enhance the learning experience and, hence, success in online classes.},

Objectives: This paper reports on the findings of an explorative study that aimed to increase our understanding of the nature and role of peer feedback in the students' learning process in a computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) setting. Exploring what types of feedback are used, and how they relate to each other and are related to academic performance has important implications for students and teachers.
Methods: This study was conducted in the higher education setting. It used a dataset consisting of student peer feedback messages (N = 2444) and grades from 231 students who participated in a large engineering course. Using qualitative methods, peer feedback was coded inductively. Epistemic network analysis (ENA) was used to analyse the relation between peer feedback types and performance.
Results: Based on the five types of peer feedback (i.e., ‘management’, ‘cognition’ ‘affect’, ‘interpersonal factors’ and ‘suggestions for improvements’), the results of the ENA showed that student feedback categories ‘management’, ‘cognition’ and ‘affect’ were positively related to student performance at the formative assessment phase.
Conclusions: The findings and the ENA visualizations also show that ‘suggestions for improvement’ and ‘interpersonal factors’ were not a significant part of student learning in peer assessment and feedback in the studied context.},

	abstract = {An in-depth analysis of collaborative problem solving (CPS) patterns contributes to understand team dynamics and effective paths to conflict resolution. However, there remains the lack of a perspective in the field of CPS research that organically combines the cognitive, meta-cognitive, and social-communicative dimensions. Moreover, the analysis of CPS sequences has primarily focused on the temporal dimension while overlooking the differences in spatial dimensions. To shed further light on the nature of CPS in computerbased environments, this study collected discourse data generated by 24 university students through an online synchronous chat tool. They were student teachers from a variety of disciplines (math, history, English, etc.) who were required to accomplish two tasks: instructional design and multimedia courseware development. Specifically, a three-stage analytical framework was proposed to code, cluster, and analyze these discourse data to further explore the differences in CPS patterns. We clustered time sequences by calculating the distance similarity metric via the dynamic time warping (DTW) method, which took into account both the spatial and temporal characteristics of the time sequences. Consequently, 16 time sequences of CPS processes were divided into 2 kinds of clusters (CPS subgroups), i.e., cluster 1 and cluster 2. From the statistical analysis, both clusters actively used the skills included in the meta-cognitive dimensions. Cluster 1 was oriented toward the solution of the problem whereas cluster 2 focused primarily on the requirements of the collaborative problem itself. From the process mining analysis, solution-driven cluster 1 tended to focus on expressing specific ideas and evaluating and summarizing them, intermittently monitoring and regulating task progress. Problem-driven cluster 2 tended to express specific ideas intermittently, and lacked the process of summarizing and evaluating different ideas to further filter out the best solutions. Finally, we summarized the implications of this study from theoretical and practical perspectives and discussed future research directions with regard to the limitations of this study.},

The results also show that effective communication significantly influences students’ academic success and the quality of faculty-student interactions. The mediating role of communication effectiveness has also been proven. These findings underscore the importance of robust communication in the faculty-student dynamics and its impact on academic performance in higher education.

We derived the questionnaire from the technology acceptance model, which is available for parents and teachers. A pilot study with teacher students (N = 36) resulted in three economically applicable scales probing perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and behavioral intention to use AI-based adaptive learning tools. We tested the factorial and criterion validity of the questionnaire for 223 parents and 141 teachers. Structural equation modelling (SEM) confirmed the hypothesized factor structure for the parents. After removing one item, SEM also supported the expected model structure for the teachers. All scales demonstrated good internal consistencies, and two items related to the constructs showed high criterion validity.},

This study therefore examines the impact of instructions and examples on the quality of feedback provided by students on peer-developed learning resources produced via an online system, RiPPLE. A randomised controlled experiment with 195 students was conducted to investigate the efficacy of the approach. While the treatment group had access to instructions and examples to support their provision of feedback, the control group had no such assistance. Students’ feedback comments were coded using an adaptation of the S.P.A.R.K. (Specific, Prescriptive, Actionable, Referenced, Kind) model. The results indicate that the instructional guide and examples led to students writing more comprehensive comments. The intervention notably enhanced the presence of feedback traits matching the S.P.A.R.K. model and increased instances where multiple traits of quality were observed in a single comment. However, despite the guide’s impact, the students’ ability to provide actionable feedback was limited. These findings demonstrate the potential of developing and integrating structured guidance and examples into online peer feedback platforms.},

While the affordances and pedagogical impacts of traditional in-person, “paper-and-pencil” peer assessment have been studied extensively and are relatively well understood, computerized (online) peer assessment introduced not only shifts in scalability and efficiency, but also entirely new capabilities and forms of social learning interactions, instructor leverage, and distributed cognition, that still need to be researched and systematized. Despite the ample research on traditional peer assessment and evidence of its efficacy, common vocabulary and shared understanding of online peer-assessment system design, including the variety of methods, techniques, and implementations, is still missing. We present key findings of a comprehensive survey based on a systematic research framework for examining and generalizing affordances and constraints of online peer-assessment systems. This framework (a) provides a foundation of a design-science metatheory of online peer assessment, (b) helps structure the discussion of user needs and design options, and (c) informs educators and system design practitioners. We identified two major themes in existing and potential research—orientation towards scaffolded learning vs. exploratory learning and system maturity.

	abstract = {Resource-management learning strategies are particularly important for performance in higher education. Despite this consideration, the current state of research still lacks evidence on the precise interplay of the different learning process components that affect academ­ ic performance. The aim of the present study was to test a mediation model derived from process theories of self-regulated learning, in which students' knowledge about resource-management strategies impacts their academic performance via its behavioural manifestations. N = 106 university students took part in an online course over the period of one semester. Students' resource-management strategy knowledge was assessed at the beginning of the semester, and their use of resource-management strategies was observed via log data of their learning behaviour during the semester while learning through the online course. Academic performance was assessed on the basis of an exam at the end of the semester. The mediation model was tested for three different resource-management strategies: time management, effort regulation, and help seeking. There was a significant indirect effect of strategy knowledge via strategy use on academic performance for all learning strategies considered. We conclude that students' strategic learning behaviour is an indispensable link in the relationship between their strategy know­ ledge and academic performance, and discuss implications for research and training practice.},

            Feedback is critical in providing personalized information about educational processes and supporting their performance in online collaborative learning environments. However, giving effective feedback and monitoring its effects, which is especially important in online environments, is a complex issue. Although providing feedback by analyzing online learning behaviors, it is unclear how the effectiveness of this feedback translates into online learning experiences. The current study aims to compare the behavioral patterns of online system engagement of students who receive and do not receive machine learning-based temporal learning analytics (ML-LA) feedback, to identify the differences between student groups in terms of learning performance, online engagement, and various system usage variables, and to examine the behavioral patterns change over time of students regarding online system engagement. The current study was conducted with the participation of 49 undergraduate students. The study defined three engagement levels using system usage analytics and cluster analysis. While t-test and ANCOVA were applied to pre-test and post-test scores to evaluate students’ learning performance and online engagement, lag sequential analysis was used to analyze behavioral patterns, and the Markov chain was used to examine the change of behavioral patterns over time. The group receiving ML-LA feedback showed higher behavior and cognitive engagement than the control group. In addition, the rate of completing learning tasks was higher in the experimental group. Temporal patterns of online engagement behaviors across student groups are described and compared. The results showed that both groups used all stages of the system features. However, there were some differences in the navigation rankings. The most important behavioral transitions in the experimental group are task and discussion viewing and posting, task posting updating, and group performance viewing. In the control group, the most important behavioral transitions are the relationship between viewing a discussion and making a discussion, then this is followed by the sequential relationship between viewing individual performance and viewing group performance. The results showed that students’ engagement behaviors transitioned from light to medium and intense throughout the semester, especially in the experimental group. For learning designers and researchers, this study can help develop a deep understanding of environment design.},

	abstract = {In an endeavor to tackle the limitations of fixed collaborative scripts and to further support collaborative learning practices, adaptive collaborative scripts have been implemented within the educational domain. However, the divergent findings surrounding the efficacy of adaptive collaborative scripts engendered a compelling need for a comprehensive understanding of the adaptive scripts. This study explored the effectiveness of adaptive scripts through a systematic analysis of 11 meticulously chosen studies and demonstrated the distinct contributions offered by varying types of adaptive collaborative scripts (namely, fading-out scripts, adaptable scripts, and self-adaptive scripts). The results underscored adaptive scripts yielded a favorable impact on the caliber of collaboration and on learners’ psychological contentment. Nonetheless, the ramifications on learning outcomes were inconclusive. Under the guidance of activity theory, this review uncovered the optimal application conditions of each variant of adaptive script. The fading-out scripts necessitated supplementary consistent support to ensure satisfactory learning outcomes. Adaptable scripts demonstrated stable efficacy when employed for students with good self-regulation ability. The self-adaptive scripts yielded optimal results in learning activities with higher-level educational objectives. Distributed roles within learning groups and perceived adaptivity also influenced the efficacy of self-adaptive scripts. Implications, limitations, and future directions were also provided.},

The material was analysed using the Critical Incident Technique and Interpretive Description through the lens of potential for resilient performance.
Results: The findings were synthesized into four themes: ‘Navigating uncharted waters under never-­ending pressure’, ‘Balancing on the brink of an abyss’, ‘Sacrificing the few to save the many’ and ‘Bracing for the next wave’. Frontline decision-­making during a pandemic contribute to ethical dilemmas while necessitating difficult prioritizations to adapt and respond to limited resources. Learning was manifested through effective information sharing and the identification of successful adaptations as compared to maladaptations.
Conclusions: During pandemics or under other extreme conditions, decisions must be made promptly, even amidst emerging chaos, potentially necessitating the use of untested methods and ad-h­ oc solutions due to initial lack of knowledge and guidelines. Within ambulance care, dynamic leadership becomes imperative, combining autonomous frontline decision-­making with support from management. Strengthening ethical competence and fostering ethical discourse may enhance confidence in decision-­making, particularly under ethically challenging circumstances.},

The other component, performance goal orientation, emphasises demonstrating competence. This quantitative study collected questionnaire and behavioural log data from 39 learners and examined the interplay between achievement goal motivation and metacognitive skills within an online social annotation envir­ onment. Findings revealed that mastery goal orientation positively correlated with metacognitive planning and regulation, while per­ formance goal orientation was predominantly associated with metacognitive regulation. Neither goals significantly correlated with metacognitive monitoring. Cluster analysis indicated that ‘balanced achievers’ with higher performance goal orientation may play a pivotal role in promoting social cognition. These insights deepen understanding of motivating learners and creating effec­ tive online learning approaches by leveraging the influence of achievement goal motivation on metacognitive strategies.},

This research aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the i-Genius module in enhancing students’ performance in science. The i-Genius module’s development adhered to the ADDIE model, and two specific research questions were formulated: i) is there a statistically significant difference in mean scores between the experimental and control groups? and ii) to what extent can i-Genius contribute to students’ conceptual evolution compared to traditional methods? To address these questions, a sequential mixed-method approach involving interviews, pre-tests, and post-tests was implemented in two distinct schools in the Seremban District. The experimental group comprised 35 participants, and the control group also included 35 students with similar characteristics. Student performance, assessed through pre-test and post-test mean scores, revealed that students exposed to i-Genius achieved significantly higher scores than those exposed to traditional methods in the post-test (t(68)=8.37, p{\textless}0.05). This study’s implications lie in its practical application within the school context, offering an alternative instructional tool for teaching science and presenting an instructional model to guide teachers in formulating strategies that encourage problem-posing within the science curriculum.},

The results reveal an ambiguous and rather superficial understanding of AI within the target group as well as a limited incorporation of AI into vocational practice despite a broad consensus regarding its increasing relevance. Recommendations for the design of online learning resources include a focus on AI basics to promote a foundational understanding, consideration of opportunities, risks and limitations in professional contexts, and the use of specific application examples. Building on this, the AI\_VET course series was implemented through a participatory approach. Initial evaluation results suggest differentiated usage of the course modules and acceptance among learners.

The present study looked at a group of university students (N = 149) engaged in peer editing of one another’s essays in an online security studies course. The analysis was conducted from two perspectives: feedback givers and feedback receivers. More specifically, the relationships between the giving of comments and tracking changes in peer’s work and writing score on essays were explored. The results showed that there was a positive correlation between the total number of received comments and the student’s writing score, whereas there was no correlation for the number of tracked changes (neither words deleted, nor words added). Surprisingly, students who assume that peers provide high quality tracked changes demonstrate worse writing performance. This research shows the importance of nuance in understanding peer editing types and their influence on students’ performance, as well as highlighting potential complexities of the interplay between students’ collaborative activities, their performance, and their attitudes.},

	abstract = {Multimodal learning analytics (MMLA) offers the potential to provide evidence‐based insights into complex learning phenomena such as collaborative learning. Yet, few MMLA applications have closed the learning analytics loop by being evaluated in real‐world educational settings. This study evaluates the effectiveness of an MMLA solution in enhancing feedback and reflection within a complex and highly dynamic collaborative learning environment. A two‐year longitudinal study was conducted with 399 students and 17 teachers, utilising an MMLA system in reflective debriefings in the context of healthcare education. We analysed the survey data of 74 students and 11 teachers regarding their perceptions of the MMLA system. We applied the Evaluation Framework for Learning Analytics, augmented by complexity, accuracy and trust measures, to assess both teachers' and students' perspectives. The findings illustrated that teachers and students both had generally positive perceptions of the MMLA solution. Teachers found the MMLA solution helpful in facilitating feedback provision and reflection during debriefing sessions. Similarly, students found the MMLA solution effective in providing clarity on the data collected, stimulating reflection on their learning behaviours, and prompting considerations for adaptation in their learning behaviours. However, the complexity of the MMLA solution and the need for qualitative measures of communication emerged as areas for improvement. Additionally, the study highlighted the importance of data accuracy, transparency, and privacy protection to maintain user trust. The findings provide valuable contributions to advancing our understanding of the use of MMLA in supporting feedback and reflection practices in intricate collaborative learning while identifying avenues for further research and improvement. We also provided several insights and practical recommendations for successful MMLA implementation in authentic learning contexts.

                        Multimodal learning analytics (MMLA) seeks to generate data‐informed insights about learners' metacognitive and emotional states as well as their learning behaviours, by utilising intricate physical and physiological signals.
                      
                      
                        MMLA has not only pioneered novel data analytic methods but also aspired to complete the learning analytics loop by crafting innovative, tangible solutions that relay these insights to the concerned stakeholders.
                      
                      
                        A prominent direction within MMLA research has been the formulation of tools to support feedback and reflection in collaborative learning scenarios, given MMLA's capacity to discern intricate and dynamic learning behaviours.

However, there are some issues that result from the lack of in-person engagement, which hinders the growth of interpersonal skills, and technological obstacles, which cause disparities, underline the limitations of the method, emerge as an urgent problem statement. The challenge lies in finding a harmonious balance between the advantages of online learning, such as enhanced accessibility and flexible learning experiences, and the critical need for face-to-face interaction that fosters interpersonal skills. Additionally, addressing technological barriers becomes essential to ensure a more equitable and inclusive educational landscape. Despite these obstacles, the adaptability of online learning is particularly evident in times of crisis, requiring a balanced perspective to fully exploit its potential for effective and inclusive education. Therefore, The purpose of this study is to determine the social skills and online collaborative learning usage levels of UTHM students, as well as to investigate the correlation between these factors. Using online surveys and questionnaires, Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia (UTHM) obtained data from 203 respondents for quantitative study. Using the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS), the quantitative data will be analysed and the results will be presented as frequency, percentage, mean, and standard deviation. Notably, there is a substantial link between all the factors with social skills, with the highest correlation coefficient observed in the interaction aspect, reaching 0.904.},

            Despite the growing interest in using multimodal data to analyse students' actions in Computers‐Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) settings, studying teacher's orchestration load in such settings remains overlooked. The notion of classroom orchestration, and orchestration load, offer a lens to study the implications of increasingly complex technology‐supported learning environments on teacher performance. A combination of multimodal data may aid in understanding teachers' orchestration actions and, as a result, gain insights regarding the orchestration load teachers perceive in scripted CSCL situations. Studying teacher orchestration load in CSCL helps understand the workload teachers experience while facilitating student collaboration and assists in informing design decisions for teacher supporting tools. In this paper, we collect and analyse data from different modalities (i.e. electrodermal activity, observation notes, log data, dashboard screen recordings and responses to self‐reported questionnaires) to study teachers' orchestration load in scripted CSCL. A tool called PyramidApp was used to deploy CSCL activities and a teacher‐facing dashboard was used to facilitate teachers in managing collaboration in real time. The findings of the study show the potential of multimodal data analysis in investigating and estimating the orchestration load experienced by teachers in scripted CSCL activities. Study findings further demonstrate factors emerging from multimodal data such as task type, activity duration, and number of students influenced teachers' orchestration load.},

Media is related to learning technology such as technology in communication, collaboration, assessment, visualization, and online learning. The use of science learning media in developing TPACK consists of two types, the first using a single type of media and the second using multiple types of learning technology media. The learning context includes micro in the form of classes, meso in the form of schools, and macro in the form of the wider community, as well as the context of teachers and pre-service teachers. The context of science education in TPACK relates to the type of research such as micro-level using mixed research methods, experimental, qualitative, research and development, and macro level usually using survey research. The TPACK framework is an approach to explaining effectiveness, evaluation, and reflection in the use of learning technology.},

	title = {Contact teaching versus 3d collaborative online virtual learning: an engineering student perspective},
	abstract = {A collaborative virtual learning environment (CVLE) is generally understood as a digital shared multiuser world where students can join and move freely. Such a system provides an ideal setting for peer-assisted learning, since it mimics key affordances found in a regular classroom setting whilst lacking many of the constraints. While many studies explore the feasibility, non-functional attributes and learning impact of CVLEs, there is little empirical work dedicated to 3D collaborative learning environments. Given the current metaverse hype, tools and online services for CVLE implementation are bound to become more commonplace. Thereby, prompting educators to leverage the advantages of such teaching interfaces. This paper intends to set the tone for CVLE best practices and learning expectations by striking a direct comparison, both quantitatively and qualitatively, between face-to-face lecturing and a 3D CVLE. A group of 52 students attended four Games and Interactive Technologies Engineering lectures on gamification and serious games before spending three weeks with a 3D CVLE that comprises the same learning material. We quantitatively compared the two teaching modalities on: (a) effectiveness by means the cognitive, affective, and psychomotor (CAP) perceived learning questionnaire; and (b) student preference through a comparative Likert scale course satisfaction survey. Our quantitative results showed no significant difference in perceived learning between the two modalities and an overall lower satisfaction for the 3D CVLE mode. During the qualitative feedback sessions, we collected the reasons for the lower satisfaction scores and were able to conclude that educators who wish to pursue 3D CVLEs should ensure that: (a) their environment has a high usability rating, with minimal bugs; (b) any tasks they wish to incorporate for learning are interactive and contextual to the learning material; (c) customizable features, especially avatars, are present; and (d) the reward mechanic is not a mere accrual of engagement evidence, but impacts gameplay directly.},

Based on social cognitive theory (SCT), we propose a framework to explore the impact of contextual and individual factors on students’ intent to engage in CL. We performed structural equation modelling (SEM) to examine the relationships among three environmental factors (fairness, innovation, and social relationships), two intrinsic motivational factors (self-efficacy, outcome expectations), and students’ intent to engage in CL. The findings indicate that building a collaborative climate where students perceive fairness, innovation, and warm social relationships in the classroom facilitates their intention to engage in CL. In addition, students’ intent is influenced by their belief in their ability to engage in CL activities (selfefficacy) and their outcome expectations. The findings have several implications for developing the theory of CL and educational policymaking.},

We used topic modeling to investigate how multiattributional diversity affects discussion topics and subsequent group performance. Twenty topics were derived by Latent Dirichlet Allocation and assigned to 17,720 forum posts by 342 groups of psychology freshmen. Multiattributional sociodemographic diversity was negatively related to the number of posts in two topics concerned with time management and feedback mechanisms in groups where multiattributional task-related diversity was also high. These topics were positively related to subsequent group performance ratings.

	abstract = {Background  The positive effects of active and passive music activities on older people with dementia are well and largely documented by the literature. Nevertheless, the use of music as a non-pharmacological intervention is not so common both in private and public older people care facilities because in-home staff have no competencies for delivering such activities. Conversely, the realization and implementation of a co-designed music-based curriculum for dementia care professionals may help the diffusion of music in the older people care facilities. This study was aimed at evaluating the learning outcomes of the SOUND training, based on an original co-designed musicbased curriculum for dementia care professionals and implemented in Italy, Portugal and Romania.
Methods  The SOUND training study was developed through three phases: a) the co-design of the music-based curriculum for dementia care professionals, involving 55 people in the three participating countries; b) the teaching of the training curriculum to 63 dementia care professionals (29 in Italy, 17 in Portugal and 17 in Romania), delivered both in person and via a Moodle platform named Virtual Music Circle; c) the learning outcomes assessment, carried out by means of 13 self-evaluation tests, and a practical test, and the trainees’ course evaluation by a questionnaire.
Results  Most of the trainees reached the highest score in the evaluation of the theoretical competencies in the three study countries. Conversely, some practical competencies in the facilitation of music activities need to be fine-tuned. The SOUND training course was evaluated very positively in the overall structure, theoretical contents, and practical workshops by the trainees. Nevertheless, they preferred the face-to-face compared to the distance learning methodology in the three countries.
Conclusions  The SOUND training curriculum was effective in teaching music techniques and neurocognitive knowledge to dementia care professionals. Nevertheless, future courses should be differentiated for dementia care professionals with or without previous music knowledge and competencies. Moreover, the course is fully sustainable, because it does not require additional costs given that the curriculum is fully accessible online and it is also replicable because it trains professionals who can continue to apply the method in their working routine.},

	abstract = {In formal educational settings, such as online university lectures, instructional videos often consist of PowerPoint slides accompanied by a video or audio explanation from the instructor. It has been assumed that the social cues provided by the instructor’s video may facilitate affective processes and affect learning outcomes. Research on instructor presence in instructional videos has focused primarily on laboratory and online studies that are not embedded in the courses in which learners are enrolled. Therefore, we present three field studies examining instructor presence in instructional videos embedded in higher education courses to strengthen external validity (exam-relevant topic, {\textgreater} 30 min long, personally known instructor). The results of these studies show positive effects of a visible instructor compared to no visible instructor on some affective measures: social presence in Study 1 (n = 18, d = .85) and well-being in Study 3 (n = 38, d = 1.01), but not on others (well-being in Studies 1 \& 2 (n = 53); motivation in Studies 1–3, social presence in Studies 2 \& 3). They also show no effects on extraneous processing or learning outcomes (Studies 1–3). Thus, no general effect of instructor presence can be shown for instructional videos embedded in university courses in higher education, but there are also no detrimental effects. This leads to implications for future research, teaching, and design practice.},

	abstract = {Background  The online-to-offline (O2O) teaching method is recognized as a new educational model that integrates network learning into offline classroom education, while problem-based learning (PBL) is a teaching modality that guides students to apply acquired theoretical knowledge to solve practical problems. However, implementing O2O combined with PBL has not been extensively explored in nephrology residency training. This study aims to explore the efficacy of O2O combined with PBL in the standardized residency training of nephrology by comparing it with the traditional lecture-based teaching (LBT).
Methods  Sixty residency trainees who participated in the standardized training of internal medicine in the nephrology department of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine were equally allocated into O2O combined with PBL (O2O/PBL) or the LBT group demographically matched. Examinations of theory, practice skills, clinical thinking and teaching satisfaction surveys were utilized to assess the teaching effects of the two groups.
Results  Participants from the O2O/PBL group outperformed those from the LBT group in the examination of theory (81.233 ± 9.156 vs. 75.800 ± 7.009, mean ± SEM), practice skills (104.433 ± 3.569 vs.100.316 ± 4.628, mean ± SEM) and clinical thinking (88.933 ± 4.473 vs. 86.667 ± 3.844, mean ± SEM). There was no significant difference in the teaching satisfaction between the two groups.
Conclusion  The current study shows the positive impact of O2O combined with PBL approach on standardized residency training in nephrology without reducing teaching satisfaction.},

	abstract = {Background  The clinical learning environment (CLE) plays a crucial role in shaping the learning experiences and professional development of medical professionals. Understanding and optimising this environment is essential for improving doctors’ knowledge acquisition, clinical skills, and overall well-being. The development of the Postgraduate Hospital Educational Environment Measure (PHEEM) and its translation to numerous languages has been a milestone in clinical education. Even though PHEEM was recently translated into Arabic, its psychometric properties in this form remain unevaluated. Therefore, this study aims to conduct a comprehensive psychometric analysis of the Arabic version of the PHEEM questionnaire. Methods  This is a cross-sectional questionnaire survey validation study. The defined population were medical residents in Damascus, Syria. A paper-based survey as well as an online-based one were conducted using several nonprobability sampling methods namely, convenience, river and, snowball sampling between June 15, 2023, and June 21, 2023. Both exploratory (EFA) and confirmatory (CFA) factor analyses were conducted. Several psychometric criteria were applied including scree plot, eigenvalue {\textgreater} 1.5 and the ‘proportion of variance accounted for’ criterion. Results  A total of 543 participants completed the questionnaire (56.9\% female). Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure for sample adequacy was high (0.937) and the P-value for Bartlett’s test was {\textless} 0.001. EFA revealed five meaningful factors which were labelled: perception of teachers, learner’s engagement and social participation, external regulation, work culture, and living conditions. These factors had the following eigenvalues: 12.6, 2.18, 2.03, 1.86, and 1.41 respectively, with a total explained variance of 43.45\%. Cronbach’s Alpha was 0.938. CFA confirmed the model structure of EFA (SRMR = 0.067 and RMSEA = 0.066). The Average Variance Explained (AVE) value of any given factor was {\textgreater} 0.7. Discussion  The Arabic PHEEM inventory demonstrated satisfactory psychometric properties. The extracted domains are of theoretical relevance to the psychosocial-material conceptual framework for learning environment. Nonetheless, this validation was performed in the Syrian context; therefore, future studies in other Arabic countries are recommended to support the applicability of Arabic PHEEM in the wide Arab World.},

Online group assessment (OGA) focuses on assessing peer-group work in an online environment. A total of 64 student teachers participated in this study, where they were divided into multiple groups of four. Each group was required to collaborate on completing an instructional design and engage in OGA activities. We utilized the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) scale to assess the instructional designs of student teachers, evaluating their ability to integrate technology, pedagogy, and content knowledge. In this research, we consider the TPACK scores of each group’s instructional design as their learning performance. The correlations between providing, receiving, and responding to comments and group learning performance were explored by adopting a mixed methods approach. The results indicated that OGA enhanced group learning performance. Providing comments was more associated with improved group learning performance than receiving and responding to them. Furthermore, providing informative comments was more associated with group learning performance than providing other types of comments. In addition, innovative responses were positively associated with group learning performance, while uptake responses were negatively associated with group learning performance. Finally, the discussion and suggestions of intervention for different stages of OGA are provided to help design and implement OGA activities in the future.},

However, our understand­ ing of teachers’ roles when implementing LA in classroom practices remains nascent. This study investigates how teachers can imple­ ment LA to support students’ agency in directing their own inquiry, when engaging in a digital pedagogy approach known as Knowledge Building (KB) on an online platform called Knowledge Forum (KF). Together with a teacher experienced in KB and KF, we co-constructed interventions anchored on two easy-to-use LA tools in KF, the Scaffold Tracker and Word Cloud. These LA interventions were enacted with a Grade 5 class of 18 students and another Grade 6 class of 18 students. Three teacher roles were identified: detecting behaviour unproductive to collaboration, mediating between LA and student self-assessment, and framing student-generated lines of inquiry in actionable ways. We coded KF notes for the discourse moves they reflected and found that after the teacher implemented the LA interventions, notes that sustained inquiry increased sharply with students’ focus shifting from individual to collective knowl­ edge and from superficial explanations to deep understandings. We discuss the implications of these findings on the development of ways to bridge LA research and practice.},

This qualitative case study addresses this gap by examining the experiences of an EFL teacher educator and her 16 students during a twelve-week enacting dialogic pedagogy mediated by Microsoft Teams (MT). Utilizing thematic analysis from thirteen video recordings, four discussion forums, three series of teacher interviews, student feedback, and researchers' observations, the study revealed that the classroom dialogue was facilitated in MT by structuring the online environment, enhancing synchronous video conferencing through ‘meet now,’ extending dialogue through chat-based learning in ‘channel,’ and enriching interaction with multimodal cues. The study suggests that while digital technologies can enhance dialogic activities, it is crucial for teachers and students to enhance and maintain their dialogic stance and digital competence in online classrooms.},

Method: During the simulation, the “school nurse” (BSN student) collaborated with a telehealth provider (NP student) to provide patient care. The Teamwork and Collaboration Subscale (TCS) of the Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale (RIPLS) measured the students’ intraprofessional collaboration. Results were analyzed using descriptive and inferential strategies. Responses to an open-ended question were content analyzed.
Results: TCS scores increased from pre- to post-simulation suggesting the simulation increased learner’s readiness for intraprofessional collaboration. Students expressed enthusiastic appreciation for the simulation experience and the importance of developing intraprofessional collaboration skills.

	abstract = {High school students in rural and semi-rural areas are disadvantaged because their schools struggle to attract and retain instructors who are qualified to teach career and technology courses that ready students for the knowledge economy. The effects of the pandemic moved much knowledge-economy work online by adopting study-from-home (SFH) models; however, educational institutions have been slow to validate corresponding study-from-home instructional models. In response, the current study developed study-from-home instruction using a multimedia-enabled, serialized worked-example artifact to teach financial accounting and modeling for high school students. The study featured grounded theories that inform the design of SFH instruction and online facilitation for a yearlong study. The instruction aimed to promote the far transfer of domain-specific, career-development knowledge regarding financial accounting and modeling. To do so, authors conducted a quasi-experiment with 50 students from five public high schools in rural and semi-rural East Texas. The result shows that socially situated SFH instruction whose design follows the principles of cognitive load theory, situated learning, and cognitive apprenticeship promoted mastery-of-learning outcomes over the course of an academic year. Our findings indicate a promising new direction in the design of remote instruction that delivers complex content to small-screen mobile devices for high school students.},

Many colleges and universities tasked with teacher preparation are seeking post-pandemic solutions to teacher preparation which potentially involve virtual experiences. This study investigates literature (N = 176) related to the use of virtual reality and augmented reality in teacher preparation. This literature review seeks to examine 11 years of empirical work as a foundation for current and future teacher preparation practice. Studies surveyed vacillate between the use of extended reality (augmented reality, virtual reality or mixed reality) either related to specific content delivery or attitudes toward the use of augmented or virtual reality. A key finding is that preservice teachers who are exposed to extended reality as part of their preparation programs develop skills, acceptance and comfort with such technological innovation. Implications are discussed for increased low risk, experiential learning opportunities which serve to support increased teacher self-efficacy and educator retention.},

Research indicates that early exposure to listening activities significantly influences the development of these skills, particularly in preschool-aged children, given their rapidly evolving cognitive and linguistic capacities. This qualitative study investigates the efficacy of employing metacognitive strategies within storytelling sessions to enhance listening comprehension among preschoolers in Kepong, Malaysia. Data collection involved a combination of interview, checklist and anecdotal observations across three storytelling sessions, capturing the engagement of six participating children. The study was structured in two phases: Phase 1 encompassed the collection of baseline data regarding teaching methodologies and encountered challenges, while Phase 2 focused on the implementation of tailored metacognitive strategies to assess English listening comprehension skills among the children. The findings reveal that the integration of metacognitive techniques positively impacts preschoolers’ listening comprehension abilities. This research contributes to the existing literature by offering insights into the specific application of metacognition within storytelling contexts, highlighting its potential to foster enhanced comprehension skills among young learners. By addressing this gap in the literature, this study underscores the significance of metacognitive approaches in early childhood education, particularly within multicultural settings such as those found in Kepong, Malaysia.},

The approach aims to gradually introduce students to new challenges and concepts through three stages of learning: Use, modify and create, within a mathematical educational context. The research design is a case study conducted in the context of a first-year undergraduate course on programming with applications in mathematics. Data collection involves participant observation of students’ mathematical problem solving, wherein the researcher assumes the roles of teacher and group activity facilitator. The observations are carried out in eight separate sessions with students at the undergraduate level, solving a mathematical task. Data analysis adopts an inductive strategy based on the interplay between the Use-Modify-Create framework and the empirical data. The main findings of the study are threefold. Firstly, the connections between MT, CT, and programming prove weak for most students. Secondly, while some students claim that the Use-Modify-Create approach has supported their understanding to some extent, its overall impact remains unclear. Thirdly, the teacher’s role as a mediator and facilitator is crucial to students’ progress. Implications drawn from the results aim to enhance students’ mathematical problem-solving skills through better design and implementation of the Use-Modify-Create approach, particularly in integrating MT, CT, and programming.},

	abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is an important twenty-first-century skill. Since the edited volume at hand aims to look at artificial intelligence, the relationship between CT and artificial intelligence is first discussed. CT comprises computational concepts, computational practices, and computational perspectives. This chapter aims to investigate the predictors of computational perspectives among high-school students. The hypothesized predictors are grouped into three areas: (1) student characteristics, (2) home environment, and (3) learning opportunities. Computational perspectives are captured with the Computational Thinking Scale (CTS) that comprises five dimensions: creativity, algorithmic thinking, cooperativity, critical thinking, and problem solving. N = 202 high-school students act as the sample, and linear regression is the analysis method used. The best in-sample prediction is possible for algorithmic thinking (R2 = .511). For cooperativity, the explanatory power of our model is rather weak (R2 = .146). Across all five CTS dimensions, CT self-concept is the best predictor for computational perspectives. There are also findings that contradict the developed hypotheses. Mathematics skills negatively predicted creativity. The association between reasoning ability and cooperativity was negative, contrary to evidence that more intelligent individuals are better at cooperating. Moreover, critical thinking was negatively associated with the duration of computer use. The results are compared with findings from a study that relies on a performance test to measure CT.},

Affective Computing, a subfield of AI, is dedicated to recognizing, comprehending, and appropriately responding to human emotions. Its objective is to enhance human-machine interactions by fostering more personalized and emotionally resonant experiences. To envision a scenario where an emotionally intelligent AI becomes a close companion, a multilinear narrative unfolds. This narrative guides the audience through various phases of the protagonist’s life, starting from the initial day of secondary school to the poignant moment of losing a loved one in midlife. The chapter outlines a systematic approach employed to craft and validate this multilinear interactive scenario, followed by the presentation of experimental results involving 164 participants. The overarching aim is to apply this methodology for educational purposes, particularly in fostering ethical contemplation and responsible innovations.},

In addition, we created and evaluated a multiple regression analysis model using the operation logs from the programming exercise system for predictions and effective feedback provision to students. With the model, we could predict final exam scores using system operation logs from the early-­ stages of the course. Additionally, we could update the score predictions based on each week’s class logs and provide feedback to students. This predictive model has implications for educational practice and allows for timely interventions for learner success. Furthermore, we confirmed the model’s good performance by comparing the scores predicted using past data with the actual scores. The study is particularly strong in identifying key variables and presenting detailed statistical analyses. This makes its conclusions both valuable and actionable for educators.

The findings reveal ChatGPT and Bard’s significant potential in customizing learning, aiding pedagogical activities, and fostering student engagement, while also noting concerns over academic integrity and the ethical use of AI. The tools show promise in medical education and other scholarly practices, but their anthropomorphic qualities and the difficulty in distinguishing AI-generated content raise concerns about the need for critical engagement from students.

Undergraduate students (n = 90) read an assigned textbook chapter and attended lectures and labs, and then were asked to write a 300-word summary of the lesson content. Data consisted of the essays converted to networks and the end-of-unit multiple choice test. Comparing similarity to the expert network benchmark, the essay networks of those who received anchoring concepts were not significantly different from those who did not. However, those who received the anchoring concepts were significantly more like their peers’ essay networks (mental model convergence) and were more like the networks of the two PowerPoint lectures. Furthermore, those receiving the anchoring concepts performed significantly better on the end-of-unit test than those who did not. Term frequency analysis shows that the most network-central concepts had the greatest frequency in the essays, the other terms’ frequencies were remarkably the same for both the anchoring concepts and no concepts groups, suggesting a similar group-level underlying conceptual mental model of this lesson content. To further explore the influence of anchoring concepts in writing prompts, essays were generated with the same two writing prompts using OpenAI (ChatGPT) and Google Bard (i.e., Gemini). The quality of the essay networks for both AI systems were equivalent to the students’ essay networks. More research is needed to understand how including anchoring concepts in a writing prompt (i.e., prompt engineering) influences students’ essay conceptual structure and subsequent test performance.},

	abstract = {The exponential growth of scholarly publications in recent years has presented a daunting challenge for researchers to keep track of relevant articles within their research field. To address this issue, we examined the capabilities of InfraNodus, an AI-Powered text network analysis platform. InfraNodus promises to provide insights into any discourse, uncover blind spots, and enhance a scholar’s perspective by representing text as a network graph with relevant topical clusters and their relations. To explore the tool’s effectiveness in analyzing scholarly articles, we embarked on an AI-assisted review of research papers, initially using a set of 15 abstracts and 15 full papers. It transpired that InfraNodus could indeed create plausible topical clusters and apparently meaningful patterns from abstracts, but its generated questions and summaries lacked both relevance to and coherence with the articles’ contents, sometimes misconstruing concepts and constructs. A deeper understanding of how the AI operates within the tool would benefit researchers seeking to optimize their literature review processes, as well as to understand the grave risks AI-generated plausibility and appearance present to academic ethics and intellectual integrity.},

It investigates the issues concerning the integration of Large Language Models into the creative process, by exploiting AI’s linguistic and knowledge-­based skills. The proposed approach envisages a mediated interaction with a semantic space constructed from an extensive catalogue of artistic and critical content. The investigation outlines how the use of AI in the creative cycle can trigger divergent forms of conceptualization, and how these appear as divergent paths in the semantic space. This opens the possibility to qualify the creative process through the traces produced by the interaction with the AI. Since many of the parameters that are relevant in the experimental setting, such as the nature and the arrangement of the knowledge base, the arrangement of the tasks, the conversational traces, and the related semantic paths are, to our knowledge, novel in this form to the scientific investigation, the preliminary results reported here concern mainly the outline of the methodological framework through preliminary experimental results. Furthermore, the research is limited to conceptual processes, neglecting other fundamental domains such as perceptual and kinesthetic processes, as well as social aspects.},

	abstract = {In collaborative learning, students may follow different trajectories that evolve over time. This study used a multilayered approach to map the temporal dynamics of online problembased learning (PBL) and the transition of students’ roles across time over a full year duration. Based on data from 135 dental students across four consecutive courses throughout a full academic year, the students’ discourses were coded based on the community of inquiry (CoI). A mixture model was used to identify students’ roles. The roles identified were leaders, social mediators, and peripheral explorer roles, and they were visualized using epistemic network analysis (ENA). Similar trajectories were identified and visualized using sequence and process mining. The results showed varying activity levels across three trajectories. Students in the active-constructive trajectory took on leadership roles, while the students in the social interactive trajectory were mostly social mediators, and the free rider trajectory showed a predominant peripheral explorer role. The students in all trajectories returned to their initial roles, showing features typical of stable collaborative dispositions. Both active trajectories (active constructive and social interactive) had very close levels of achievement, whereas the free riders demonstrated lower grades compared to their peers. This research suggests that understanding role dynamics and their evolving trajectories can help teachers better design future collaborative activities, assign roles, form groups, distribute tasks, and, more importantly, be able to support students.},

This research used snowball sampling to solicit 30 online participants of various higher education institutions for qualitative interviews. The learners’ stories were then analyzed using qualitative analysis to identify key themes among them and to build a theory of how learners viewed the role of trust in online social learning. The findings revealed that the learners found themselves in either trusting or trust-compromised social learning groups which positively or negatively impacted their learning outcomes, respectively. We discovered that the interdependence among learners necessitates trust; that trust is universally breached in all social learning contexts but is reconstructed only within trusting groups, and that learners inevitably reach out for help to complete assignments; regardless of their group trust. Implications, limitations, and future research recommendations are provided.},

The ﬁndings revealed that the GenAI chatbot provides useful feedback as students rate the chatbot’s answers higher than their peers’ answers (MChatbot = 4.11, MStudents = 3.91). The presence of the chatbot has an effect on group communication with the length of messages increased in chat rooms where the chatbot was present. Moreover, chatbot behavior to rate the students’ answers was correlated with the students’ behavior. The present study offers valuable insights into the optimal strategies for integrating a GenAI Large Language Model into educational tools and computer supported learning.},

Results showed that directed observation led to higher teamwork quality and slightly better usability scores, suggesting it provided a more structured and predictable environment. Both modalities achieved high levels of detail attention and personal reﬂection in learning outcomes, though active participation encouraged slightly greater understanding and engagement. The ﬁndings underscore the potential of collaborative virtual 3D museums to enhance educational experiences, indicating that structured observation can facilitate teamwork and usability. Active participation may boost personal engagement with content. Further research with larger samples is needed to conﬁrm these results and optimize collaborative activities in virtual settings.},

The ﬁndings indicate a positive correlation between students’ levels of Perspective Taking and messages oriented to socialization. While, groups with higher max values under cognitive and affective empathy demonstrated a positive correlation with task-oriented messages.

A cross-case analysis, including a correlation analysis of teachers’ motivations and their perception about different incentive mechanisms, suggests that there is a relationship between these factors. Teachers’ main motivation is to gain knowledge, and they perceive recommendation systems, tutorials, news sections and social features as the most interesting features to be implemented in an OC of teachers. In contrast, they consider reputation as the least important motivator, and they do not perceive features such as users’ rankings or contributors’ acknowledgement sections as important. These results contribute to the improvement of the supporting platforms for OC of teachers and the integration in teaching practice.},

The aim of this study was to develop a model in order to analyse the key factors affecting purposeful online collaborative learning. The participants in the study were 799 students in higher education who had experienced this type of methodology. A questionnaire was created, organized into 7 constructs. This was used to produce a research model with reflective variables using the Partial Least Squares (PLS) technique, which demonstrated good predictive ability (R2=0.712). The 10 hypotheses underpinning the model were confirmed. The results indicate that variables such as satisfaction, perceptions of use and enjoyment, and group dynamics had a significant, positive influence on students’ perceptions of online collaborative learning. Mediating variables of interest were also identified, such as intra-group emotional support (R2=0.595)—with its link to perceived enjoyment—and the importance of online tools and group dynamics as fundamental elements for developing proper emotional support within the framework of CSCL processes. Finally, the results are discussed, along with their impact on improving teaching in higher education when implementing CSCL.},

	abstract = {Virtual learning environments are technological systems designed to use electronic media to enable nonface-to-face education and interaction between students to take place. The research presented here considered six academic years and was carried out against the backdrop of the impact that these environments are having on higher education. It used a non-experimental, retrospective, cross-sectional approach, and was conducted within the qualitative phenomenological paradigm. The participants were 211 students who were engaged in an online postgraduate course. The aim was to identify the benefits and difficulties the students encountered when they used collaborative tools in their learning process, and the group dynamics that were established. Portfolios, forums and focus groups were the mechanisms used for data collection. The results showed a great diversity in how digital tools were used, how they were adapted to the complexity of the virtual classroom and the multi-professional profile of the participants. However, in general, the participants displayed a strong need for connection in order to share their concerns, develop bonds and build collective knowledge. There was greater emphasis on collaborative tasks during and after the pandemic than in previous periods. It was concluded that the integration of online collaboration tools among postgraduate students to carry out academic activities reflected the key role that virtual environments play in the shaping of meaningful interdisciplinary and socialisation educational experiences. In addition, the role of the group's own self-regulation in terms of maturity, networking, chronological adjustments and understanding of the task at hand was essential in the participants’ ability to overcome the challenges they encountered.},

Based on the standard deviation of extraversion and prior knowledge, groups were established to test experimentally, what form of grouping leads to best outcomes. The randomized controlled trial took place in the context of an online course with 355 prospective students, working in 82 groups. The two characteristics extraversion and prior knowledge were distributed algorithmically, either homogeneously or heterogeneously. Results showed no superiority of heterogeneous formation, yet there were systematic interaction effects by the experimental group formation on satisfaction and performance. Due to the increasing relevance of online groupwork, explorative results are reported and integrated. Ideas for future research on group formation as an important influencing factor are discussed. Findings supports knowledge about cooperative online learning by optimizing the selection of group members using a therefore implemented algorithm.},

According to the Minimax Theory, the policy model is designed as a guidance network and an execution network, the guidance network predicts the current situation and outputs the predicted disadvantageous situation, and the execution network selects the optimal maneuvering behaviors based on the predicted situation and self-state, which improves the model’s out-of-distribution generalizability through decoupling of the situations and behaviors. Updating the parameters based on the implicit Q-learning algorithm (IQL) during training improves the model performance by utilizing the in-distribution data. Simulations are based on the data sampled from suboptimal policy, and the results show that the algorithm improves the episode returns, and the generated policy model presents better intelligence.},

Speciﬁcally, we set two SSL models to focus on pseudo-labeling and consistency learning, respectively. Leveraging online knowledge distillation, we orchestrate collaborative learning between two models, facilitating mutual enhancement. In addition, we introduce dynamic model conﬁdence to guide the independent and mutual learning of these models, encouraging the models to learn more reliable information from unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets for blood cell and skin disease classiﬁcation show signiﬁcant performance improvements with our proposed framework.},

Video recordings (∼148.5 h) of collaborative interactions and pre- and post- situated selfreports of learners’ task perceptions were collected. The collaborative sessions were clustered and collaborative interaction patterns were examined. Finally, learners’ task perceptions in the clusters were investigated. The results showed different collaborative interaction patterns and differences in learners’ task perceptions between the clusters. The main finding is that continuous active participation in socioemotional interactions alongside cognitive-focused interactions and appropriate group-level regulation of learning positively influence learners’ perceived task understanding. These findings add to current understanding of collaborative interactions as temporal processes and contribute to practical implications for supporting collaborative interactions to enhance metacognitive skills.},

It pre­ sents an ongoing action research project in collaboration with a high school in Western Australia, involving four teachers to inte­ grate GenAI in their classrooms. The study aims to develop and evaluate innovative pedagogies for leveraging GenAI to enhance educational practices and student learning outcomes across three action research teams focusing on critical questioning, assessment and differentiation. Drawing on Bakhtin’s concept of heteroglossia, the study conceptualizes GenAI not as a definitive knowledge provider but as a dialogic agent that facilitates collaborative dialo­ gue and co-construction of knowledge among students. This per­ spective aims to encourage students to critically engage with AIgenerated content and integrate multiple viewpoints into their learning, thus fostering key epistemic skills. Initial findings demon­ strate active student engagement in dialogues with GenAI, high­ lighting the use of follow-up questions that indicate critical thinking and creativity. These findings underscore the significance of inte­ grating multiple perspectives and fostering epistemic skills among students, promoting a comprehensive and ethical approach to AI use in education. The research calls for further exploration of GenAI’s pedagogic potential and its broader implications for edu­ cational practices, suggesting a promising avenue for pedagogical innovation and the development of critical thinking skills in the digital age.},

This research employs a within-subject two-factor experimental design to investigate the influence of the CL mode on the reading comprehension performance and cooperation level of students with and without VI, considering two text types. The independent variables are CL modes (positive interdependence {\textless}PI{\textgreater} vs. individual accountability {\textless}IA{\textgreater}) and text types (narrative vs. expository). Reading comprehension performance is the outcomeoriented variable, and cooperation level (including knowledge construction, social interaction, and content contribution) is the process-oriented variable. Findings reveal challenges for VI and sighted upper-grade elementary students in reaching higher levels of knowledge construction during cooperative reading tasks. The PI mode demonstrates higher levels of knowledge construction for narrative texts, while the IA mode shows superior content contribution for expository texts. Notably, VI students achieve lower reading comprehension scores than sighted students in the IA mode and face disadvantages in knowledge construction and content contribution across different reading comprehension scenarios. Building upon these findings, this study put forward suggestions to improve reading comprehension and cooperative participation for VI students.},

Through the lens of Morphogenetic and Affordance Theories, the research delves into how educational technologies provided opportunities and support for these students. However, this study showcases how the affordance of educational technologies, including digital learning platforms, online resources, and communication tools, has empowered marginalized students to overcome obstacles and thrive academically. By adopting a morphogenetic approach perspective, the research elucidates the dynamic interplay between technological affordances, social structures, and individual agency in shaping the educational experiences and achievements of historically marginalized students. Through a critical realist case study, the study highlights the transformative potential of educational technologies in promoting equity, inclusivity, and academic success within higher education institutions. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex interactions between technology, education, and social justice, offering insights for policymakers, educators, and practitioners striving to create more inclusive and equitable learning environments.

	abstract = {Online one-on-one tutoring serves as a personalized approach to supplement classroom instruction. However, with the growing tutoring market, a single tutor often handles inquiries from students across primary, middle, and high school levels. Consequently, the extent of tutors’ interactions with students of varying grades and their use of tutoring strategies to enhance student learning remains unclear. To address this gap, we collected and analyzed 1500 tutoring dialogues from amateur mathematics tutors concurrently instructing students from primary, middle, and high school levels. These dialogues were annotated using a coding scheme and a well-trained powerful artificial intelligence (AI) model. The interaction dynamics were subsequently examined using epistemic network analysis and lag sequential analysis, yielding findings on the occurrences, co-occurrences, and sequential patterns of dialogic strategies. First, the results reveal that tutors frequently engaged in off-topic behaviors and direct instruction, regardless of students’ educational level. Second, tutors’ constructive questions and knowledge sharing and instruction were more associated with greater constructive expressions from students at higher educational levels, while primary students primarily demonstrated simple acknowledgment. Third, tutors exhibited limited sequential patterns of dialogic strategies when tutoring primary and middle school students, mainly focusing on questionasking behaviors and evaluation and feedback. In contrast, tutors displayed diverse patterns across various categories of dialogic strategies when instructing high school students, emphasizing the facilitation of students’ reasoning and metacognition. These findings underscore the importance of training tutors to develop dialogic skills and adopt tailored pedagogical approaches for different educational levels, ensuring effective and efficient online one-on-one mathematics tutoring.},

	abstract = {The ethical use of engagement data in online education is a growing concern as institutions increasingly rely on learning analytics. This study explores students’ perceptions of engagement data collection and usage by focusing on their attitudes towards privacy and data management. We conducted a survey among students (n=108) who participated in online education to understand their views on data collection practices, privacy concerns, and preferences for data handling. The results demonstrate that while many students are comfortable with their engagement data being used for personal and instructor dashboards, significant concerns remain about privacy, particularly with the collection of facial expressions and chat participation data. Students emphasized the importance of transparency and control over their data and they highlighted the need for clear communication and consent processes. These findings illustrate the necessity for ethical data practices that ensure students feel secure and informed about how their engagement data is utilized.},

With the use of sensing technology, we can capture learners’ states in near real-time and support learning. Moreover, multimodal data allows us to obtain early predictions of learning performance, and support learning in a timely manner. In this contribution, we utilise the notion of ‘carry forward effect’, an inferential and predictive modelling approach that utilises multimodal data measurements detrimental to learning performance to provide timely feedback suggestions. Carry forward effect can provide a way to prioritise conflicting feedback suggestions in a multimodal databased scaffolding tool. We showcase the empirical proof of the carry forward effect with the use of three different learning scenarios: game-based learning, individual debugging, and collaborative debugging.},

Using a cross-sectional survey design, data were collected from 244 Indonesian EFL teachers, encompassing both pre-service and in-service teachers. Through multiple regression analysis and Rasch modelling analysis, the study evaluated the association between teachers’ IDLE participation, demographics, and their teaching creativity. Findings of the present study revealed that Indonesian EFL pre-service and in-service teachers actively participate in Informal Digital Learning of English (IDLE), which impacts their teaching creativity. Nearly half (49.18\%) engage strongly in activities like listening to English songs and watching YouTube videos, while 36.88\% moderately engage in online educational content and social media conversations. A smaller group (13.93\%) shows lower engagement in IDLE. The regression analysis revealed that while IDLE significantly predicted teaching creativity (p {\textless} 0.001), demographic factors did not indicate a substantial influence on creativity in teaching practices. Additionally, a Rasch-Wright map analysis unveiled that over half of the participants displayed strong creativity in teaching, with a notable inclination among younger teachers towards innovative and student-centered pedagogical strategies. The findings of the current study highlight the need for further exploration into the dynamics between informal digital learning, demographics, and creative teaching approaches, emphasizing the potential for fostering innovative pedagogical practices in language education.},

This represents a significant technological advancement that poses opportunities and challenges to educational research and practice. This commentary brings together contributions from nine experts working in the intersection of learning and technology and presents critical reflections on the opportunities, challenges, and implications related to GenAI technologies in the context of education. In the commentary, it is acknowledged that GenAI’s capabilities can enhance some teaching and learning practices, such as learning design, regulation of learning, automated content, feedback, and assessment. Nevertheless, we also highlight its limitations, potential disruptions, ethical consequences, and potential misuses. The identified avenues for further research include the development of new insights into the roles human experts can play, strong and continuous evidence, human-centric design of technology, necessary policy, and support and competence mechanisms. Overall, we concur with the general skeptical optimism about the use of GenAI tools such as LLMs in education. Moreover, we highlight the danger of hastily adopting GenAI tools in education without deep consideration of the efficacy, ecosystem-level implications, ethics, and pedagogical soundness of such practices.},

A consistent positive relationship between Satisfaction and Academic Performance is found in all the regions. Malaysia presents a unique situation as compared to Mainland China and Hong Kong whereby no association was found between Social Context and Online communication towards Student Engagement. The novelty of this study is attributed to the integration of Social Presence Theory in Student Engagement through the nature of online learning as a coping strategy to halt the spread of COVID-19 during the Omicron variant surge.},

This study sought to understand how scaffolding support enhances cognitive presence during the learner–content interaction process in the online environment. Two learning modules on introductory science concepts were developed incorporating the predict observe explain (POE) pedagogical framework. Students engaged with these learning modules to learn the science concepts independently. Data sources comprised post-module interviews, written responses, and observations of student interactions with the online learning modules. Analysis of discussions revealed that the adopted pedagogical framework can effectively foster student cognitive presence during the learner–content interaction process. Findings further revealed that the scaffolding elements embedded into the learning modules contribute to the emergence of higher levels of cognitive presence especially for the students with prior knowledge. Conversely, this study provides evidence that students may develop misconceptions about the science concepts even with the embedded scaffolding and guidance. This study calls for further research into the continual improvement of the pedagogical approach to stimulate cognitive presence for both advanced and novice learners and reduce the potential risk of misconceptions occurring during the learner–content interaction process.},

This paper proposes a set of design goals for the implementation and deployment of engaging interactive public display applications in educational settings. Based on findings from a series of design workshops and two deployment studies in authentic settings, seven design goals were identified and defined. The design goals provide clear guidelines for the design of IPDs for schools by making design teams and stakeholders focus on factors fostering user adoption, social interactions and collaboration. The design goals also opened up paths for further explorations regarding display awareness, level of commitment in interactions, the displays’ integration into structured activities, and display management at the educational institutions.},

A feasibility study was conducted to examine the patterns of group interaction and individual students' contributions to the critical discussion and their perceptions of the critical discussion activity. We found that more students used text‐based communications than audio, but students who used audio collaborated with each other more frequently. In addition, student engagement in argumentative discourse varied greatly across groups as well as individuals. At the end of the discussion, most groups provided a solution that integrated both sides of the controversial issue. Survey and interview results suggest an overall positive experience with this technology‐supported critical discussion activity. Using the insights from our research, we develop a conceptual dialogue analysis framework that identifies relevant skills under the argumentation and collaboration dimensions.

Speciﬁcally, they were asked about the types of data they were most interested in, the aspects of student learning that they would consider important, and the actions they would take upon viewing the data. Overall, we found that participants’ scores were medium-high (2.5–3.5 on a 5-point Likert scale), with scores being higher for women compared with men and positively correlated with experience with Moodle. An overarching theme arises from our analyses of instructors’ interests and intentions, which portrays their idea of teaching as somewhat traditional and instructor-centered; however, their declared actions make it clear that they are willing to make some desirable changes to the beneﬁts of students. Finally, we found that instructors’ perceptions of data use and data importance are positive predictors of taking action upon viewing student data.},

              Socially shared regulation of learning (SSRL) is a crucial process for groups of learners to successfully collaborate. Detecting and supporting SSRL is a challenge, especially in real time, but hybrid intelligence approaches such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents may make this possible. Leveraging the concept of trigger events which invite SSRL, we present a design of an AI agent, MAI, which can detect SSRL and prompt students to raise their group‐level metacognitive awareness with the aim of facilitating SSRL. We present the methodology we used to design MAI, drawing on the Echeloned DSR (eDSR) Methodological Framework and making use of the Wizard of Oz prototyping paradigm. We likewise present empirical results evaluating our initial prototype of MAI, using lexical alignment between speakers as a quantitative measure of the effect of MAI's prompts on facilitating SSRL, the Partner Model Questionnaire as a quantitative measure of perceptions of MAI, and interviews as qualitative context for these perceptions. We found that the first prototype of MAI did not facilitate SSRL as hoped, possibly owing to mixed perceptions of MAI's reliability and lack of clarity about MAI's role in the collaborative learning task. From these findings, we offer revised prompts for the next iteration of prototyping this agent and a refined set of design requirements for future development of metacognitive AI agents for supporting SSRL.

                        Socially Shared Regulation of Learning (SSRL) is recognized as a critical component for the success of collaborative learning, emphasizing the importance of group‐level regulatory processes in achieving shared goals, enacting strategies and monitoring learning progress.
                      
                      
                        Supporting SSRL in face‐to‐face collaborative learning environments presents challenges, including the complexity of coordinating and synchronizing individual contributions and regulatory actions within a group context.
                      
                    
                  
                  
                    What this paper adds
                    
                      
                        This paper introduces the design of Metacognitive Artificial Intelligence (MAI), a novel AI system aimed at enhancing Human‐AI collaboration for supporting and augmenting SSRL processes.
                      
                      
                        Through empirical research, the study offers lessons learned and design considerations for developing artificial agents on facilitating and enhancing SSRL among learners, demonstrating how AI can play a pivotal role in collaborative learning environments.
                      
                      
                        The findings highlight the critical importance of multidisciplinary knowledge in the design of multi‐agent interfaces (MAI) that provide real‐time, adaptive support for group metacognitive processes and decision‐making.
                      
                    
                  
                  
                    Implications for practice and/or policy
                    
                      
                        Educational technologists can utilize the proposed design principles in the development and integration of MAI tools to enhance SSRL.
                      
                      
                        Educators can incorporate the principles of MAI and our relevant findings into their teaching strategies to actively foster and support socially shared regulation of learning among students.
                      
                      
                        Policymakers should consider revising educational frameworks to include the use of AI technologies that support SSRL strategies in collaborative learning.},

The paper describes how a targeted LA intervention was grounded within the ICAP theory for active learning to identify, visualise and analyse student engagement metrics in a 100\% online setting. The architecture of the model, including its design principles and underlying assumptions, are broadly examined against the latest research in educational, LA, and data analytics research. This includes a discussion of our initial phase testing results of captured student data alongside a discussion of key questions and desired study outcomes for the upcoming phase 2 of the data intervention. As a result, this paper provides both specific insights into how we created an evidence based and pedagogically sound evaluation model of online student engagement within a specific suite of asynchronous educational tools, as well as more general and practical insights into how other universities could develop similar approaches to enhance understanding and support of a growing online student population.},

Moreover, existing research primarily focuses on individual differences, such as self-regulation and motivation, overlooking the potential of feedback literacy (FL).

This study aims to investigate the impact of LA-based feedback on knowledge acquisition and transfer, specifically focusing on the role of FL. Ninety-five students participated in a quasi-experimental design with three feedback conditions: Process feedback with FL practice, Process feedback only, and Outcome feedback. The study utilized a learning environment with an LA dashboard and prompting features. Participants underwent pre-tests and post-tests evaluating their knowledge acquisition and transfer related to effective instructional methodologies for online teaching. The study shows that LA-based process feedback enhances knowledge transfer but not acquisition. Notably, FL moderates this impact, emphasizing its crucial role in maximizing LA-based feedback benefits. The study underscores the importance of prioritizing FL development in educational institutions. The study offers valuable insights into LA, FL, and learning outcomes, guiding informed and customized feedback practices in education.},

Results: Our findings showed comparable performance expectations between newly graduated and experienced paramedics, mismatches in role clarity of paramedic work, challenges in both learning and upholding professional competence, and difficulties of social acceptance into the paramedic community. There were variations in how expectations were perceived between groups, indicating that experience might partly affect how paramedics identify and manage performance expectations. The organizational socialization framework enables the contextualization of these performance expectations.
Conclusions and Implications: Paramedic work involves challenges to upholding clinical competence, aligning to a professional role, and social integration into the professional community.

Chatbots were primarily created on web platforms for text-based communication, though few explored hybrid channels (text, voice, images) for enhanced interaction. Chatbots are used for teaching, customer service, and mental health support in HE. Users’ behavioral intention, perceived usefulness, ease of use or communication, design, interactivity, social influence, service quality, digital literacy, privacy and security, and ethical issues are some of the factors and concerns that influence the acceptance of chatbot in HE. Common research issues were correlational and cause-effect studies, learner perceptions, technology acceptance, engagement, learning performance, user satisfaction, and self-efficacy. However, areas such as cognitive load and higher-order thinking remain underexplored.

            Searching for information on the web has become an essential task in our society. This article presents a preregistered experimental study that investigates how the knowledge dimension (conceptual, procedural) and relevance of displaying spatiotemporal changes (high, low) for a given search task affect searchers' preference for different resource modalities (websites, videos). Additionally, effects of source reputation (high, low) were examined. Participants were confronted with 16 learning tasks and respective mock‐up video or website search results and had to indicate the likelihood of selecting the respective search results. The learning tasks varied regarding their knowledge dimension and their degree of spatiotemporal changes. Search results varied regarding source reputation and resource modality. Study results showed that search results with low source reputation were more likely to be selected when they were video results as compared to website results. Furthermore, for learning tasks with a high degree of spatiotemporal changes, a preference for videos over website results was found, while a low degree of spatiotemporal changes did not lead to modality preferences. To conclude, both knowledge dimension and degree of visuospatial changes of learning tasks seem to be promising classifications to consider for understanding users' source and modality selection during web‐based learning.},

To train the LCS, an augmented dataset is derived from an online survey study featuring scenarios simulating alternate airport decision-making problems where state variables, reﬂecting aircraft conditions, and three airport options were presented to pilots.

Objective: The study aimed to use participatory action research methods to develop and evaluate an online Professional Practice Forum that is a key component of the OTAC teaching and learning experience.
Methods: Three evaluation cycles were implemented with three cohorts of participants (N=40) to inform the design and review of the updated OTAC course. Overall, the study relied on participatory action research methods to enhance a sense of online community and to revise the Professional Practice Forum component of the course. Findings from survey feedback and an examination of Web metrics were used to monitor participant learning and were subsequently subject to thematic analysis in order to identify key themes.
Results: The use of participatory action techniques in the redesign of the OTAC course was a successful means of engaging with participants and resulted in four revisions based on feedback from facilitators and participants. The Professional Practice Forum was rated highly and received positive feedback from both moderators and participants.
Conclusions: The use of interactive forums in online learning in an educational module for adult learners can prove extremely valuable as a means for participants to share their expertise and improve their learning outcomes. In particular, the use of sticky and welcome threads were significant features that enhanced interactions between participants and facilitators and resulted in increased quantity and quality of postings. These findings can help inform future researchers on how to develop peer engagement modules that are amenable to assessment and that build an online sense of community.},

	abstract = {Anatomical education is transitioning from the time-honored cadaveric dissection to a blend of learner-centered and technology-enhanced learning approaches. In view of the increased use of various technologies for teaching and learning human anatomy, the aim of this study is to explore students' acceptance of four learning technologies using the technology acceptance model (TAM). This work was conducted at a graduate medical school in Singapore with first-year MD Program students. The acceptances of the four learning technologies were compared in two studies. In Study 1 (n = 46), we compared a 3D-printed (3DP) model with Primal Pictures to answer a clinical question in a Spine Anatomy Tutorial; in Study 2 (n = 55), we compared the Anatomage Table and Primal VR for a Brain Anatomy tutorial. There was a statistically significant preference (p {\textless} 0.05) for 3DP models over Primal Pictures for learning Spine Anatomy, and for Primal VR over Anatomage for learning Brain Anatomy. The perceived ease of use of any technology does not appear to influence the behavioral intention to use it. Qualitative feedback suggests that visualization and spatial relationships were among the most important facilitators of learning. Technology should be an enabler in learning but some technologies have a steeper learning curve than others. Therefore, to increase its perceived usefulness, educators must leverage the affordances of the technology when designing learning activities.},

The second aim is to provide recommendations from the participants themselves to other students with impairments and to higher education institutions for improving their success in higher education. The results show that the participants have different conceptualisations of success (achieving a degree, getting good grades, learning and developing skills, gaining practical experience, overcoming challenges and maintaining a balance between studies and health) and identiﬁed various personal factors (the disability as a driving force) and contextual factors (social and family environment, time abroad, positive feedback, recognition of achievements and accessible online courses and digitised materials), as relevant to their success. The ﬁndings further demonstrate that hearing the voices of graduates with impairments is critical to their success in higher education and the empowerment of students with disabilities.},

Even though professional competences of student teachers have already been widely discussed based on several theoretical models, no study to date examines the promotion of student teachers’ competence development in practice. As part of this framework, we established a competence grid for student teachers to assess and support individualizing students’ learning paths. The grid is meant to stimulate self-reflection, which should help individuals raise awareness for their learning progress and make performance levels visible. Initial empirical results from a survey with first and second semester students (n ¼ 309) demonstrated practical applicability and reliability (a ¼ .82) of the assessment grid, which allows to design further steps towards professionalisation.},

How learners interact with each other in support of learning has been a topic of rich theorization for some time, from early work on face-to-face cooperation to more recent attention focused on computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL). This chapter unpacks four different relationships between collaborative learning theory and learning analytics (Application, Testing/Refinement, Generation, and Implementation) by examining work related to theories of joint attention, online listening, and knowledge building. Considering the relationship between theory and analytics as mediated by elements of technology, pedagogy, epistemology, and data, the chapter offers guidance for selecting relevant collaborative learning theory for particular analytic uses and overviews central issues to be considered in such use (e.g. group versus individual units of analysis, leveraging constructs and/or process models, inclusion of temporality, appropriate audiences to interpret and act on analytic outputs).},

In our investigations, we relied on video data and on-site observations, utilizing and further developing visual data analysis methods. Our findings assist in expanding the scope of computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) research toward sociomaterially mediated knowledge creation, revealing the open-ended, nonlinear, and self-organized flow of the co-invention projects that take place around digital devices. Our findings demonstrate the practice-based, knowledge-creating nature of these processes, where computer engineering, product design, and science are deeply entangled with design practices. Furthermore, embodied design practices of sketching, practical experimenting, and working with concrete materials were found to be of the essence to inspire and deepen knowledge creation and advancement of epistemic objects. Our findings also reveal how teachers and peer tutor students can support knowledge creation through co-invention.},

This paper used temporal motif analysis to examine the changes in team members’ cohesive perceptions and behaviours, including task cohesion, performance outcomes, engagement and group synchrony. Trace data from an online workintegrated learning environment captured learning behaviours, while responses to a questionnaire at different stages of a study program captured task cohesion and cohesive perceptions. The findings reveal teams with strong task cohesion and high performance tend to share similar cohesive perceptions driven by interdependent interactions. Conversely, teams with different cohesion perceptions have lower interaction interdependence and poorer performance. Through analysing team interaction data, this study uncovered key insights to promote positive adjustments aligning team perceptions, enhancing collaborative learning and offering support for improved performance, engagement and synchrony among teams, ultimately benefiting learning outcomes and the cultivation of skills and competencies.},

	abstract = {Video‐based teacher online learning enables teachers to engage in reflective practice by watching others' classroom videos, providing peer feedback (PF) and reviewing others' work. However, the quality and reliability of PF often suffer due to variations in teaching proficiency among providers, which limits its usefulness for reviewers. To improve the quality of PF, hybrid intelligence is a promising approach that enhances human evaluation with AI‐based techniques. Thus, we developed a hybrid intelligence feedback (HIF) system, where PF is categorized and summarized by large language models (LLM), and accompanied with AI multimodal data analysis, all in accordance with a knowledge structure. To investigate the effectiveness of the HIF, we conducted a study involving 58 pre‐service mathematics teachers. After their initial feedback provision on a classroom video, they were divided into two groups. One group received HIF, while the other received traditional PF. Both groups revised their initial feedback based on the same video with PF or HIF report, and were assigned two tasks, namely in‐depth reflection and extensive reflection. We analysed the reflective writings generated in in‐depth reflection using the Structure of Observed Learning Outcomes taxonomy, and examined the diversity of teachers' attentions in extensive reflection using information entropy. Compared to traditional PF, our findings indicated that HIF (a) facilitated more comments added in feedback revision, (b) promoted multi‐structural and extended abstract level thinking in in‐depth reflection, (c) encouraged more diverse attentions in extensive reflection. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of HIF in enhancing PF to promote reviewers' reflection. This efficacy can be attributed to the utilization of LLM to identify common elements within PF, guided by the human knowledge‐based framework, as well as the integration of data‐driven evidence to complement PF.

                        Video‐based teacher online learning allows teachers to reflect on their own or others' videos flexibly while providing and reviewing peer feedback using reflection tools.
                      
                      
                        While the benefits of reflecting on one's own videos with peer feedback are widely recognized, there is limited empirical evidence supporting the advantages of reflecting on others' videos with peer feedback. The effectiveness of this process may be affected by the quality and reliability of the peer feedback provided.
                      
                      
                        Using natural language processing techniques to enhance peer feedback can be feasible and effective. However, it is primarily used to address textual‐level issues and is less effective in promoting professionalism.
                      
                      
                        Multimodal data analysis has shown effectiveness in enhancing teaching behaviours and facilitating reflection. However, despite the widespread use of AI‐based analysis on classroom videos, they often lack educational interpretations.
                      
                      
                        Hybrid intelligence is a novel concept in learning science research, aiming to leverage both human and machine intelligence to enhance the overall effectiveness.
                      
                    
                  
                  
                    What this paper adds?
                    
                      
                        This study applied the concept of hybrid intelligence to video‐based teacher learning by proposing a hybrid intelligence feedback (HIF) system, aiming to promote teachers' reflection on others' videos during the peer feedback review process.
                      
                      
                        This study proposed the design of HIF module, where human peer feedback was enhanced by large language models, and machine data analysis was complemented with educational interpretations, all structured according to an expert knowledge structure.
                      
                      
                        The results showed that the HIF was effective to stimulate teachers' higher‐level thinking in in‐depth reflection and enhanced the diversity of their attentions in extensive reflection. However, it may still be challenging for novices to comprehend and integrate newly noticed pedagogical strategies in the HIF with their internal knowledge structures during reflection.
                      
                    
                  
                  
                    Implications for practice and/or policy
                    
                      
                        With the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence, the utilization of large language models becomes more flexible and effective, enabling multitasking enhancement for peer feedback in collaboration with human's professional knowledge.
                      
                      
                        Multimodal data analysis effectively collaborates with human observations by managing low‐level observation aspects, allowing humans to concentrate on higher‐level thinking guided by the educational interpretations.
                      
                      
                        The effectiveness of the HIF system is influenced by teachers' pedagogical knowledge, prior feedback provision experience and data literacy. In the future research, these diversities need to be taken into account in the design of video‐based PD incorporating HIF to assess its long‐term efficacy.},

	abstract = {Virtual simulation is an interactive experience that allows people to immerse themselves in a computer-generated environment. In recent years, virtual simulation technology has become more affordable and accessible, and more educators are using it as an active learning and engagement tool. With science education’s emphasis on interactivity, visualization of concepts, and a strong reliance on experimentation in its empirical domain, virtual simulation technology can play an important role in science education by taking advantage of its strengths. This study presents a systematic review of research on the utilization of virtual simulation technology in science education over the past decade. In this review, 73 articles were screened from three major databases using string and manual screening protocols. This literature review, emphasizes the analysis of virtual simulation-based science education from two aspects including pedagogy (instructional environment, instructional activity design, and technology design) and instructional outcomes. The findings reveal important factors such as trends in the application science education pedagogy, pedagogical effectiveness, types of equipment, and research methodology, as well as whether or not teacher training is required for the use of virtual simulation. Finally, the practical implications of virtual reality-based teaching and directions of future research are discussed.},

	abstract = {Role recognition is critical for labor division and risk identification in group coordination during collaborative learning. Students’ social, cognitive, behavioural, and emotional performance during collaboration are essential dimensions for role recognition. However, most studies classify roles using single dimensions, such as cognitive (knowledge construction level) or social (social network status), neglecting behavioral and emotional indicators. This study develops a multidimensional role recognition model integrating social, cognitive, behavioural, and emotional features to automatically detect students’ roles (coordinator, inquirer, assistant, marginal) during collaboration. Results show that the multidimensional model outperforms singledimensional models, with ensemble classifiers (e.g., random forest, XGBoost) outperforming single classifiers (e.g., support vector machine, decision tree). Additionally, an interpretable framework is proposed for global and local explanations of the model. Globally, social, cognitive, emotional, and behavioural factors influence role recognition, with eight key features identified for each role. Common features, such as investment and overall responsivity, influence all roles, while others vary in their impact. Locally, the framework supports personalized interventions, such as tailored collaborative scripts. These findings offer valuable insights for researchers and practitioners, enabling early identification of roles associated with academic risks and the design of targeted instructional strategies.},

	abstract = {Background: The use of actors as standardised patient-instructors (SPI) in clinical interview training in the psychiatry module of the medical curriculum is welcomed by medical students. This study aims to examine the effectiveness of this training in enhancing medical students’ psychiatric interview skills.
Methods: This was a single-blind randomised controlled study with two arms. Between 17 July 2023 and 26 January 2024, year 5 medical students of The Chinese University of Hong Kong who were studying the psychiatry module and had completed the introductory lecture on clinical interview skills were invited to participate. Participants were asked to rate (1) the helpfulness and adequacy of the existing clinical interview training and (2) their confidence in implementing the clinical interview skills. Participants were then randomly assigned to the intervention group or the control group. Participants in the intervention group received a single clinical interview training workshop through a teleconference platform around mid-module, whereas participants in the control group received teaching as usual. Each workshop involved one trained SPI and two students and lasted for 2 hours. Students engaged in two psychiatric scenarios (post-traumatic stress disorder and delusional disorder). The actor interacted with the students and then provided feedback and guidance based on the four key learning points, namely respectful and sincere attitude, attunement, reflective listening, and empathetic understanding. While one student was practising with the actor, the other student observed and provided peer feedback. Outcome measures included the interview skill sub-score and total score of the Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) at the end of the module, as well as perceptions of participants on the workshop.
Results: Of 279 eligible students, 112 were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (n=58, 52\% female) or the control group (n=54, 52\% female). The intervention and control groups were comparable in terms of module-end written examination score, interview skill sub-score of OSCE, and total score of OSCE. Despite this, participants provided highly positive feedback for the clinical interview training using the SPI approach, and 98.3\% considered that the session had a positive effect on clinical communication skills. Nonetheless, the post-workshop confidence levels of participants were not correlated with the interview skill sub-score or the total score of OSCE. Similarly, participants’ perceived positive feedback of the workshop was not correlated with the Interview skill sub-score or the total score of OSCE.
Conclusion: Small-group online clinical interview training using the SPI approach is welcomed by students. Positive subjective outcomes may not match with objective outcomes. Further studies are needed to establish the benefit of the SPI approach.},

	abstract = {The goal of the present study was to assess biology students’ level of understanding and identify their misconceptions about cellular concepts. We conducted a questionnaire survey followed by interviews. Study participants (n = 620) were students enrolled in a biology degree programme. Data analysis showed that students had low knowledge of the basic characteristics of cells. Misconceptions were identified in all four core competencies of cell biology education. The most identified common misconceptions concerned the relationship between the structure and function of the cell membrane, nucleus and endoplasmic reticulum. Students have difficulty making the connection between cellular transport and its relationship to the structure of the plasma membrane. Students also struggled to make the connection between the different levels of organisation (macroscopic, microscopic and molecular). However, most students understood the concepts related to the chemical constituents of cells. Several potential factors are responsible for the appearance of misconceptions among the participants in this study, including levels, failure to use learning resources to visualise the various phenomena that take place in the cell, incomprehensible terms, and complexity of the processes and mechanisms of cell biology which, to understand them, require recourse to concepts taught in other disciplines such as physics and chemistry.},

	abstract = {Recent research on learning analytics dashboards has focused on designing user interfaces that offer various forms of visualization guidance (often referring to notions such as data storytelling or narrative visualization) to teachers (e.g., emphasizing data points or trends with colour and adding annotations), aiding them in interpreting visual elements to gain a comprehensive understanding of students’ learning processes. Yet, while some studies have explored how teachers interpret students’ data through these dashboards, many have overlooked the diverse technical capabilities of teachers, which can significantly impact their use of LA dashboards. In particular, visualization literacy (VL) skills can greatly influence how effectively teachers interpret dashboards. To the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive account exists that details how teachers with varying VL skills interpret visual representations of students’ data. In this paper, we address this gap by investigating how teachers interpret LA dashboards, both with and without visualization guidance, taking into account their VL. We illustrate this by analyzing teachers’ think-aloud sessions as they engage with dashboards in the context of monitoring synchronous online learning tasks undertaken by student groups using Zoom and Google Docs. Using epistemic network analysis, we examine the differences in interpretations between teachers with varying VL levels. Our findings revealed that teachers with low VL exhibited shallower dashboard interpretations than those with high VL. However, the association of VL with successful task completion rate was not significant. Also, visualization guidance did not enable teachers to deepen their interpretations. While some visualization guidance helped teachers to complete tasks correctly, excessive visualization guidance can also be detrimental.},

Peer feedback systems often support student reviewers through instructor-generated comment prompts that include various scaffolding features. However, there is little research in the context of higher education on which features tend to be used in practice nor to which extent typical uses impact comment length and comment helpfulness. This study explored the relative frequencies of twelve specific features (divided into metacognitive, motivational, strategic, and conceptual scaffolds) that could be included as scaffolding comment prompts and their relationship to comment length and helpfulness. A large dataset from one online peer review system was used, which involved naturalistic course data from 281 courses at 61 institutions. The degree of presence of each feature was coded in the N = 2883 comment prompts in these courses. Since a given comment prompt often contained multiple features, statistical models were used to tease apart the unique relationship of each comment prompt feature with comment length and helpfulness. The metacognitive scaffolds of prompts for elaboration and setting expectations, and the motivational scaffolds of binary questions were positively associated with mean comment length. The strategic scaffolds of requests for strength identification and example were positively associated with mean comment helpfulness. Only the conceptual scaffold of subdimension descriptions were positively associated with both. Interestingly, instructors rarely included the most useful features in comment prompts. The effects of comment prompt features were larger for comment length than comment helpfulness. Practical implications for designing more effective comment prompts are discussed.},

	abstract = {In the rapidly evolving landscape of social media, the emergence of Influencer-led Education as a novel learning model presents a paradigm shift in the mobile learning era. To illuminate the underpinnings of learners’ inclination to embrace this model, this study adopts an integrated methodological framework, encompassing grounded theory and fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA). Based on 17 indepth interviews, an Action-Decision Framework of new model is established. Subsequently, a examination of 150 questionnaires through fsQCA uncovers diverse configurations of learners’ adoption intention of Influencer-led Education. The outcomes of the fsQCA disclose five configurations associated with high adoption intention and two configurations leading to low intention, highlighting heterogeneous representations among distinct learner cohorts within the decision framework. This research contributes to the expansion and deepening of theories pertaining to learners’ engagement with Influencer-led Education, while providing insights into the intricate mechanisms driving learning behaviors in the realm of novel learning scenarios.},

However, there is less consensus about which educational methods would guarantee successful debriefing outcomes. This article conducts a comparative study of post-simulation discussions in two professions with a longstanding history of simulation training: nursing and nautical education. We combine a literature review with a survey-based investigation (N = 168) to understand how instructors and facilitators implement their pedagogical ideas in debriefing practice. The results reveal consensus on the importance of debriefings, a shared emphasis on creating a space for self-reflection on practice in groups across practice areas. At the same time, differences emerge between nursing and nautical education in relation to the role of facilitators, focus on learning objectives, and views on instructional feedback and storytelling, both between and within educational fields.},

	abstract = {Today s problems often arise as unintended consequences of yesterday s solutions. Social systems often suffer from policy resistance, the tendency for well-intentioned interventions to be defeated by the response of the system to the intervention itself. The field of system dynamics, created at MIT in the 1950s by Jay Forrester, is designed to help us learn about the structure and dynamics of the complex systems in which we are embedded, design high-leverage policies for sustained improvement, and catalyze successful implementation and change. Drawing on engineering control theory and the modern theory of nonlinear dynamical systems, system dynamics often involves the development of formal models and management flight simulators to capture complex dynamics, and to create an environment for learning and policy design. Unlike pure engineering problems if any exist human systems present unique challenges, including long time horizons, issues that cross disciplinary boundaries, the need to develop reliable models of human behavior, and the great difficulty of experimental testing. Successful change in social systems also requires the active participation of a wide range of people in the modeling and policy design process, people who often lack technical training. In this paper I discuss requirements for the effective use of system dynamics and illustrate with a successful application to a difficult business issue.},

	abstract = {Collaborative argumentation is a crucial learning activity affected by various factors, including the use of argumentation elements, encountered challenges, and social regulation. Few studies examined how these factors collectively impact argumentation outcomes based on fine-grained process data. This research employed Chi-squared tests and epistemic network analysis (ENA) to reveal the different frequencies and patterns of these factors in 4 high- and 4 low-performing groups. The data were derived from a 90-minute argumentation task involving 55 undergraduates. The Chi-squared test revealed the frequency differences, indicating that high-performing groups tended to use strong claims, whereas low-performing groups typically used weak counterclaims/rebuttals and encountered more socioemotional challenges. The ENA results further illustrated the differences in the cooccurrences of these factors. In low-performing groups, weak counterclaims/rebuttals intertwined with socioemotional and cognitive challenges. Although students attempted to use socioemotional regulations to address challenges, their efforts were ineffective due to the tense atmosphere. Conversely, high-performing groups successfully alternated between cognitive and socioemotional regulations to formulate strong claims and overcome challenges. These findings highlight the advantages of using ENA to analyze and compare patterns of factors and suggest the need to design educational tools to support effective social regulations.},

	abstract = {Background: Collaborative learning is a common teaching strategy in design education. This study analyzes the correlation between personality types, communication styles and the learning outcomes of design students in collaborative learning in online and offline mode of teaching. The traditional approach of face-to-face learning had to be quickly adjusted with hybrid or online mode of teaching and learning process due to the onset of the pandemic COVID-19 during the last 3 years.
Methods: By comparing the data collected from two academic years, the study compares the different correlations in conducting online and offline collaborative learning environments. Students’ personality and communication style are analyzed through the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) and a four-type communication model.
Results: The findings indicate that students face different challenges in online and offline collaborative learning activities, and the correlation between personality types, personality styles and learning outcomes is different. In the offline environment, the personality traits of Thinking (T) and the personality temperament of intuitive-thinking (NT) are positively correlated with learning outcomes. Among the four communication styles, directors are positively correlated with learning outcomes. In an online environment, having the personality trait of extroversion (E) and the personality temperament of intuitivefeeling (NF) are positively connected with learning outcomes. Socializer is a communication style that is closely correlated to learning outcomes.
Conclusion: This study points out that when organizing online collaborative learning, students face challenges in building an intimate and comfortable group atmosphere, while offline learning requires more leadership-quality team members. The findings help educators understand student personalities, help teachers organize learning activities more effectively for better collaborative learning outcomes, and provide students with equal opportunities for learning success.},

	abstract = {Collaborative learning is an effective way for students to actively learn and thereby gain a deeper understanding of a specific topic, but it can be difficult for educators to monitor these discussions. This study investigates the effectiveness of Clair, an AI-powered conversational agent, in facilitating productive discussions during collaborative learning tasks. Clair uses the Academically Productive Talk (APT) framework, which includes specific "talk moves" designed to encourage students to share their thoughts, listen to each other, deepen their reasoning, and engage with others’ ideas on the basis of Michaels and O’Connor’s (2015) Four Goals for Productive Discussions (FGPD). In this study, 34 participants completed two discussion tasks: one without Clair and one with Clair's guidance. The results showed that Clair significantly increased deeper reasoning (G3) during discussions and helped improve productivity overall. Certain talk moves, like "Expand Reasoning" and "Recapping", were especially effective at encouraging deeper engagement and balancing contributions between participants. This research identified that Clair has the potential to support educators by improving the quality of collaborative discussions by guiding students. Future research should investigate how Clair can be implemented in real classrooms over time and assess its impact on students' learning outcomes.},

	abstract = {Learning with virtual reality (VR) can be highly motivating and conducive for cognitive and affective learning outcomes. For commemorative history education, VR enables novel experiences of testimonies co-created by survivors, witnesses, and museums. VR technologies allow learners to feel immediacy and an emotional connection to digitally reconstructed spaces and events of the past. While VR has proven to enhance affective learning outcomes by provoking emotions, interest, or motivation, its perceptual richness may also lead to distraction and cognitive overload. Generative learning activities can alleviate some of the limitations of learning with VR by helping learners to focus on the learning material. This study examines a highly engaging and historical immersive VR application and thereby investigates the effectiveness of the generative learning activities of self-explaining and drawing. Seventy-four undergraduate students explored a three-dimensional representation of the room where Anne Frank, a Jewish girl, was hiding during World War II. For the two experimental conditions, students had to either create drawings of Anne Frank’s room and their own room or verbally explain how Anne Frank’s living conditions would feel for them. For the control condition, students did not engage in a subsequent activity. Based on generative learning theory, we predicted that students engaging in generative learning activities would display higher posttest scores in knowledge and perspective taking than the control group. No such effects were found. Although the VR experience itself increased the ability to empathize with Anne Frank across all groups, it did not contribute to knowledge building. The study results indicate that even without any additional activity, VR can convey highly emotionally engaging testimonies and enables role taking, which suggests that VR is in particular suitable for affective learning.},

	abstract = {Background: Social context and peers significantly impact students' motivation, especially in collaborative learning settings. However, there is limited evidence on how students strategically influence each other's motivation through socially shared regulation of learning (SSRL). Aims: This study examined secondary school students' SSRL during collaborative learning, focusing on how groups regulate motivation and how these regulation processes influence individual situational motivation through peer interactions. Sample: The participants were 95 secondary school students (13–16 years) performing a collaborative science task in 31 groups.
Methods: Collaborative learning was videotaped to capture motivation regulation from social interactions. Four times during the task, individual perceptions of peer influence on motivation and motivation regulation were collected with situational self-reports, and individual stimulated-recall interviews were conducted after the task.
Results: The results showed that motivation regulation is embedded within broader SSRL processes. When motivation regulation coincided more likely with cognitive regulation, students perceived significantly higher peer influence on motivation. In interviews, students highlighted cognitive and social aspects of SSRL as crucial for their situational motivation but did not hardly recognize any direct motivation regulation strategies.
Conclusions: This study contributes to the methodological advancements for studying motivation as situation- and context-specific,emphasizingtheuseofdifferentdatachannels to capture the dynamic interplay between the individual- and group-level aspects throughout the learning process. For},

First, an adversarial simulation environment for UAV swarms is constructed, which effectively uniﬁes the environment and state representation, enhancing the response speed of our UAVs. Second, a distributed UAV swarm collaborative control algorithm based on multi-agent reinforcement learning is proposed, and an effective sparse reward function is designed to guide UAVs in adversarial gaming, making the UAV strategies more aggressive, enhancing the adversarial intensity, and further optimizing the control strategy to meet real-world demands better. Finally, the real-time performance and scalability of the proposed method are validated through simulations.},

A convergent mixed methods action research design was employed to identify changes in the levels of autonomy, competence, and relatedness of the participants in an Algebra 2 course (n = 50) at a fully online school in the northeastern United States. Results from the motivation questionnaire and student interviews indicated a significant increase in competence and relatedness after completing the intervention. While no significant increase in autonomy was evident in the quantitative results, the qualitative findings showed some support for improved autonomy. Recommendations for online mathematics course design to support increased motivation are provided.},

	abstract = {The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has prompted a significant shift toward online Education. However, this transition has raised concerns about assessment, distance learning effectiveness, and student workload. These pandemicinduced conditions may also lead to ethical challenges in education. Despite existing research on ethical issues in online education, the focus on ethical challenges related to online formative assessment, especially in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) contexts, is still limited. Therefore, this study aims to explore students’ perspectives on ethical challenges related to online formative assessment. To achieve this objective, a mixed-methods approach was employed. Initially, a qualitative phase involving online focus group discussions was conducted with three distinct groups of eight Iranian EFL learners. These groups encompassed EFL learners from universities, institutes, and schools. Each group participated in a 70-min online discussion to examine the ethical challenges they encountered in online formative assessment following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thematic analysis of the data revealed that ethical challenges could be categorized into three main areas: group work, feedback, and cheating. Subsequently, a ranking scale was employed to determine the primary category that presented the most significant ethical challenge based on students’ viewpoints. The findings indicated that feedback was perceived as the most pressing ethical challenge, followed by issues with cheating and group work categories. Finally, the gathered information was categorized based on the specific learning contexts of the participants. This research provides valuable insights for EFL teachers, policymakers, and educational assessment systems. Based on these findings, it is recommended that EFL teachers and policymakers implement targeted professional development programs, foster a culture of academic integrity, and adopt clear guidelines to address these ethical challenges.},

We engaged 73 biology faculty experts from institutions across the US in four iterative rounds to identify, rate, discuss, and re-rate ten SLOs for non-majors biology labs on the dimensions of importance, feasibility, and distribution of responsibility between lab and lecture. On average, the panel achieved consensus around eight SLOs as “important.” All of the SLOs were rated as “feasible” under optimal teaching and learning contexts, but the panelists noted that current institutional constraints render some as less feasible. Our analysis suggests that labs share many SLOs with lectures, but there are also some SLOs that are unique to the lab.

            During the COVID-19 pandemic, emergency online learning impeded the pursuit of in-person activities that usually foster successful socialization in higher education. To investigate the effects of online learning on socialization, we asked two exploratory research questions: (1) How and to what extent does the level of socialization change during the first online semester? and (2) To what extent does level of change predict course dropout and academic performance? In our case study, using a sample of new students at a large German university, we ran an autoregressive three-factorial model of socialization (role, relationships, organization) with three measurements taken during the new students’ first semester, which was the second semester in which emergency online learning took place. Our results show that the relationships component of socialization did not increase over the semester, while the role and organization components increased. Furthermore, our results support a negative effect of the organization component of socialization on course dropout and a positive effect of the relationship component of socialization on academic performance.

            Zusammenfassung
            Während der COVID-19-Pandemie beeinträchtigte der Notfallfernunterricht die Durchführung von Präsenzaktivitäten, die normalerweise die Sozialisierung im Hochschulbereich fördern. Wir untersuchten, wie sich die Sozialisierung während des ersten Online-Semesters verändert und inwieweit diese Veränderung den Kursabbruch und die akademische Leistung vorhersagt. In einer Fallstudie mit Studienanfängern einer deutschen Universität analysierten wir ein autoregressives Modell mit drei Faktoren der Sozialisierung (Rolle, Beziehungen, Organisation), basierend auf drei Messzeitpunkten. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass nur die Faktoren Rolle und Organisation anstiegen. Weiterhin ergab sich ein negativer Zusammenhang zwischen dem Faktor Organisation und Kursabbruch sowie ein positiver Zusammenhang zwischen der dem Faktor Beziehungen und der Studienleistung.},

	abstract = {Flexible online distance education enables students to interact with content and materials at their own pace and from any location. However, such individualization of students’ learning time and space masks differences between learners’ access to resources within their spatial environments and temporal contexts and, thus, might generate implicit forms of social inequity. This study examines how flexibility inherent to emergency remote online learning shapes how Israeli university students from different social groups experienced remote online learning during the Covid-19 pandemic. We thematically analyzed semi-structured interviews with 50 undergraduate and graduate students, representing diversity in terms of class, gender, and national categories. We found four spatial and temporal factors that shaped students’ ability to harness flexibility to benefit their emergency remote online learning: spatial capital, temporal capital, temporal agency, and temporal intensity. The analysis revealed how such factors were shaped by complex intersections between students’ social identities. This study suggests that higher education institutions should make flexibility inclusive and safeguard students from potential adverse effects by tailoring support to diverse student needs and ensuring consistent access to resources as needed.},

It seeks components and utterances of the community of inquiry and shared metacognition in online collaborative learning environments to bring an instructional design model to the fore. A three-cycle design-based research method was followed in two cases of university students by triangulating the quantitative and qualitative data sources. A coding scheme, the shared metacognition questionnaire, the community of inquiry questionnaire and one-to-one and focus-group interview protocols were used as data collection tools. Quantitative data were interpreted through descriptive, inferential statistics, and an open/selective coding process interpreted qualitative data. The findings pointed out that the community of inquiry framework presented a powerful theoretical ground to investigate and distinguish cognitive, social, and teaching presence episodes from shared metacognition episodes. Orientation-planning, monitoring, and evaluationreflection were proved as three main components of the shared metacognition construct in online collaborative learning settings. This study further advances the specification of each shared metacognition component from the group-related regulative actions and taskrelated regulatory actions. Moreover, a set of six instructional design principles within an instructional design model that combines the components of shared metacognition were put forward. These guidelines are intended to aid practitioners and instructional designers in the development of online collaborative learning activities.},

However, the application of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in educational practice involves certain challenges, such as thought substitution, superficial cognitive processing, and impaired deep learning. Consequently, investigating the influence of metacognitive scaffolding on deep learning within the GenAI context was the central focus of this study. This study employed a quasi-experimental research design to investigate the impacts of metacognitive scaffolding on learners’ learning approaches, cognitive proficiency levels, and academic achievements in a GenAI learning environment, thereby elucidating the ability of metacognitive scaffolding to promote deep learning. The Mann‒Whitney U test was used to examine the disparities in learning methodologies and academic performance between the experimental and control groups. The SOLO cognitive level framework was used to code transcripts of the dialogs between learners and GenAI, and epistemic network analysis was employed to examine the distribution of cognitive levels between these two groups. These findings revealed that for the learners in the experimental group, the use of metacognitive scaffolding had a significantly positive deepening effect on their tendencies toward various learning approaches and on their cognitive hierarchy. Moreover, the experimental group exhibited better academic performance.},

The students were divided into four groups comprising a mix of students from both universities. Methodologically, this case study is informed by pre- and post- survey data, screen recordings from two plenary sessions, as well as a final oral presentation and discussion in OpenSimulator. Findings show mixed experiences by the students and point to three pillars of project design that can facilitate CSCL: the platform, the international dimension, and opportunities for collaboration. While students reported that being represented as an avatar had some positive affordances over other video-based platforms, students also faced usability challenges with the platform. In terms of internationalisation and collaboration, students valued working with peers from another country, with their interactions mediated by a platform they otherwise would not have used. Overall, findings show that factors such as time, the usability of the MUVE platform, the assigned task, and the international dimension, are all essential considerations when using a MUVE to facilitate COIL projects.},

However, existing research on disruptive talk detection often relies on features from a single dimension, making it difficult to comprehensively capture the semantic information of talk and learner characteristics, which limits the detection effectiveness. To address this, we propose a multi-feature fusion model. Based on social cognitive theory, this model captures learner features from multiple dimensions, including the week of discussion, talk length, sentiment polarity of talk content, the speaker’s demographic factors and pre-test knowledge level. At the same time, the model integrates both Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) models, achieving deep fusion of talk semantics and time-series features, thereby enabling more accurate identification of disruptive talk. Experimental results on real classroom datasets show that our method outperforms existing baseline models across multiple metrics, fully demonstrating its effectiveness and practical value. This research not only advances the development of disruptive talk detection but also provides feasible insights for optimizing collaborative learning environments. Future work will explore the scalability of this model in different educational settings and investigate its integration with real-time learning platforms.},

Furthermore, different types of awareness are typically provided without meaningful integration. This study introduced an aggregated group awareness tool named SKN in the form of a social knowledge network, which presents a systematic visualization of behavioral, social, and cognitive information about learners within the online community. A quasi-experimental design was employed to investigate SKN’s impact on learners’ perceptions of the online learning environment and social interactions. The experimental group (n = 21) utilized SKN, while the control group (n = 20) did not have access. Results revealed that the experimental group demonstrated significantly enhanced social perceptions of the online environment and engaged in more social interactions compared to the control group. Interviews indicated high levels of satisfaction with the SKN tool, confirming its positive influence on the online learning experience.

	abstract = {Within our increasingly diverse higher education classrooms, nurturing learning through strategies and environments that foster inclusion and belonging has become imperative. In the post-pandemic move back to in-person teaching, a shift from online and often asynchronous modes of course delivery, both lecturers and students have encountered opportunities and challenges that present themselves when our embodiment is both perceived and felt within the educational encounter. Early in 2024, I lectured an undergraduate module in the Study of Religions, the course is positioned at an intersection of religion and gender. The module I taught critically engaged with representations of gender and sexuality specifically within Christianity, and the resources and content for the Christianity module were predominantly and intentionally from Feminist, African Feminist, and Queer Theological perspectives. Educators have noted how trust and care, principles embedded in approaches that espouse pedagogical love, promote classroom relations that facilitate active listening, dialogue, and cooperation between both teacher and student. Positioning my teaching and facilitation within the guiding framework of bell hooks’ love ethic, which also centres trust and care (in addition to commitment, responsibility, respect, and knowledge), led to a conscious and intentional weaving of feminist and engaged pedagogies, within my approach to religious studies education, and pedagogical love in the classroom. In this chapter I will be critically reflecting on this experience through (1) my own embodiment and positionality in relation to the students in the classroom, (2) the feminist orientation of the casestudy, the course content and curriculum as guided by a feminist approach to religious studies, as well as (3) the in-classroom teaching and learning engagement strategies used to facilitate learning, understanding, and connection. This critical reflection will be supported by anonymous student feedback received in course evaluations, and my observations of student participation in the classroom.},

	abstract = {Määtä and Uusiautti’s conceptualization of pedagogical love is supported by others such as Freire, Fromm, and van Manen; being a good teacher requires a loving attitude, an attachment to learners, and a strong desire to help the learner grow and develop to their best potential. The two authors work in teacher education programs where many students take classes online and asynchronously. This lack of in-person, face-to-face connection raises challenges for the relational teacher educator. To better understand how and whether pedagogical love was realized by online students, the authors sent students an anonymous survey with openended questions. The authors then analyzed these results to understand better what relational, pedagogical love these students experience in online coursework.},
